      "content": "Very odd iron wave variant. Getting more block than damage is good for you overall (although 7 is still pretty low). Has some utility to remove artifact charges. You can combine the doom with an AOE card to spread it on multiple enemies, though collector doesn't have very many of those. If you are good at applying affliction, the doom can keep ticking for multiple turns making it more valuable. Reasonable role-player in a Can't touch this deck to scale off the dexterity and stack doom faster. Usually, this card is not very exciting, it just doesn't do that much for you, but if you need a way to block in late act 1/early act 2 after skewing aggressive to beat act 1 elites, it'll work.\n\nIf you don't draw an attack or can't afford to play an attack this turn (enemies attacking for a lot of damage/need to play a scaling power instead) then you get no benefit from the doom. Quite bad into all 3 act 1 elites. You can pair it with runic pyramid to pair it with AOE attacks more easily. Upgrade is fine, but not a priority, especially since it doesn't give it that much more block. There's nothing majorly wrong with this card, it's just rather unexciting, especially comprared to some of the really strong collector cards in the same pool.",
