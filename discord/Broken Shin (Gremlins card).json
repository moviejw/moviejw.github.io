Getting to 4 stacks is fine, but 8 is a point where maybe you were winning anyways, and too often it has been just a dead draw for me. Even if it blanks one attack, that is fine but not fight winning. I would want to be in a super dedicated Fat deck before I would think about clicking on this, and it would still be way down below, say, Heckle. I probably wouldn't skip it in that deck, but I would skip it in anything that wasn't very specifically a Fat Gremlin deck, and I end up in those somewhat rarely, maybe 10%.",

      "content": "Agony is a very powerful condition, and in the right deck, this is pretty close to a draftable, 0 cost apparition, that will sometimes last 2 or more turns, especially if you upgrade it or are very good at spamming cheap attacks. It isn't very splashable outside of that deck, as you really need to make sure that you can get fat gremlin to the front to make this work, which is most doable with bulk up. Granted, that deck is already very good at applying weak, and would be drafting the more powerful heckle very highly, and so may not necessarily need this, since it's so good at mitigation already. On the other hand, the naturally low HP of each individual gremlin makes having some kind of mitigation plan for late game very necessary, and this can definitely be a good roleplayer there.\n\nOne big issue with this card is consistency, drawing it too early in a fight makes it a dead card, and you can also draw it on a turn where you aren't being attacked and waste a turn of the agony. Runic pyramid is excellent to help fix these problems, but you don't have many other ways to fix that issue. It's also not going to do very well during the early stages of the game, as applying that much weak is difficult without a more developed deck, and because fights are more about bursting enemies down rather than mitigating damage. Usually a very bad rare to see from a heart bonus and the act 1 boss. Agony becomes more valuable as the game progresses, any enemies naturally start attacking for more, and as your deck becomes more capable of supporting it, so it usually has the best chance to shine in acts 3 and 4.",
