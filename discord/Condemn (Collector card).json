      "content": "If you are trying to stack doom, and have a lot of weak, but not very much vulnerable, taking and upgrading this makes sense. Outside of that fairly specific spot, you would normally take this to help increase your damage in the early game. It is a skill, making it a liability into gremlin nob and chosen, but at least it deals damage and helps end the fight faster. It's also poor into sentries, where only the doom will be applied. I think this card has a difficult time competing with other common/uncommon sources of frontloaded damage for collector because of those issues in the early game, and I often skip this with the hopes of finding those stronger cards (forgery, jaded jabs, roast).\n\nIf this is not upgraded, then it's very important that you are able to follow it up with attacks to capitalize on the vulnerable. Just 1 stack is not going to get you very far unless you have some reasonable 0 and 1 cost attacks to go along with this, or the 4th energy/reserves. I do think that the upgrade is very powerful for this reason (see also bash and wide open) since it gives you an entire extra turn (and 3 or 4 more energy) to use the 1.5 times modifier on your damage. For collector especially that extra stack of vulnerable makes it easier to keep doom ticking as well, so this does end up being a pretty important upgrade when you do take the card, and seeing it pre-upgraded is very tempting if your deck struggles to apply vulnerable when you see it.\n\nOne slightly awkward thing about both the doom stacking and vulnerable componenets of this card is that they are often irrelevant as you head towards the lategame due to collectors other sources of damage scaling. Empower, Dark Lord Form, and Omen are all such potent and splashable sources of scaling that they tend to outshine everything else, which makes a card like this that primarily aims to apply vulnerable for linear damage scaling less appealing.",
