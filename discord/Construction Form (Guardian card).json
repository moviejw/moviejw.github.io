Played judiciously, it can act as at least a Vault and sometimes better, to buy you time to draw your Overcharge or whatever else you need to draw into your combo. It's good even in Act 1 where big expensive non attacks are dubious, because it pairs up well against Lagavulin and Nob. It's a power, so playing it thins your deck (as does not playing it due to Ethereal!) towards your combo. \n\nBefore you are going infinite every fight, the strength can be a meaningful advantage. So, the Form serves a good dual purpose by carrying you forward until you get your infinite (very important) while still not getting in your way afterwards. That's the sign of a good card, and therefore you usually should not skip Construction Form unless your deck is already comboing off consistently on turn 1 or 2. (Still take Exploit Gems over it, of course.)",

      "content": "So why's a Buffer & a conditional half a Demon Form good? There's a few reasons.\n\nOne is that, despite it costing 3 for the buffers, it doesn't cost a campfire upgrade like Defect's Buffer does. This is, in practice, a very large benefit, as having 2 buffers keeps the card relevant defensively for the rest of the game.\n\nAnother is that half a Demon Form is much more effective on Guardian, who plays slower and more defensively than other characters, and doesn't need as much strength to succeed.\n\nThe thing that pulls these things together though, kind of seems like coincidence to me. In most cases, **the fights in which you need the extra defense from the buffers, you don't need the strength, and the fights where you need the strength, you are more able to preserve the buffers.** In short, most fights will require you to have only one or the other, which means the card almost never falls flat in effectiveness.\n\nDue to the power of both 2 buffers and strength every turn, this card is extremely powerful. I almost never say a card is a snap pick, since circumstances can always change things, but this is about as close as you can get to one. And yeah, it synergizes with itself: you get the stacked strength gain from multiple copies, but only need to keep one buffer. You might have to occasionally deal with the problem of drawing multiple copies on the same turn, which makes this a tough pick for Quantum Chamber, but there are a few ways to get around it, like Snecko Eye, or Stasis, if you're willing to wait.\n\nThe one pitfall this card has, I think, is that it's difficult to use if you don't have an energy boss relic after act 1. You have a much more limited ability to preserve the buffers in the fights you need strength, and even in the fights you don't and are being attacked for a low number. Also, using Stasis to discount it is difficult due to the wait, unless you have a lot of accelerate. I personally end up taking energy relics most of the time, so it's been great.",

      "content": "A really useful card overall, capable of providing frontloaded mitigation, preserving the buffer stacks to protect you later in the fight (if the enemy isn't attacking this turn), or giving you theoretically infinite strength scaling if you can afford to wait around. The frontloaded mitigation actually feels like one of the most important parts of the card, as guardian already has several different ways to scale over time and win fights if they can get to turn 4+ safely (mostly setting up big stasis plays, setting up key powers, and working on defensive mode with brace). Just being able to cast this for 3 and buy yourself a turn or 2 to get your stasis engines online can be really useful, especially since so many key stasis cards are cheap like planning, reroute, and recover. The strength scaling component can be very helpful in the late game boss gauntlet, and is also a reasonable way to get through fights like lagavulin, the act 1 boss, and other slower fights that already give you time. Guardian has an abundance of cards that scale well with strength that make even just 1 strength a turn pretty good. I do think that the scaling isn't that important, as guardian has so many ways to scale over time already (removing debuffs to keep strength/dex, stasis setup, power spamming, protocols and brace spamming, infinites).\n\nBeing ethereal is largely a benefit, letting this get out of your way in the fights where enemies have big multi-hit attacks, or ones that are very short and the strength scaling will be too slow. You could consider upgrading it if you have runic pyramid to play it at the best possible moment, but most of the time that's not necessary, as you can often stasis this if you really need to play it in the fight, but can't afford to cast it that turn. It also has a pretty significant upside over most other forms, in that it naturally protects itself right away, so spending 3 energy on it doesn't make you take chip damage in the way that other forms do.",

      "content": "Drawing this really late in a fight can be quite bad if you were relying on it to be your offensive scaling (just like with demon form), so taking extra card draw, or using a bottle on it can be a good idea to smooth out the variance with it. More commonly, you will just include another form of offensive scaling so that you aren't too reliant on drawing this early in a fight. It's actually pretty good in act 1, especially as a neow bonus, since it's excellent against lagavulin, and very good into gremlin nob. Even in short hallway fights, it will usually cover you on the turn you cast it, and one other turn later in the fight. Comparing this to buffer for defect, it's a huge improvement to have it give two stacks of buffer without needing an upgrade, with the tradeoff being that it costs 1 more energy. It can suffer a bit in act 2 with lots of multi hit enemies like book of stabbing, gremlin leader, and snake plant, especially if you haven't found the 4th energy yet. Really good into act 3 and 4, where these kinds of expensive scaling powers already tend to do well. \n\nVery powerful if you have snecko eye to reduce the cost, or have fossilized helix to get a free stack of buffer to keep the strength scaling going longer. Mummified hand can also really help protect the buffer stacks, and bolster rod also does a reasonable job with that too. Great with the boat relics and guardian gear, which can help protect the buffer stacks as well, and potentially keep you safe for a very large portion of most fights.",

      "content": "There is significant value in a card not needing an upgrade. Upgrades are usually a very limited resource in your runs, and having a card be completely functional or even very good without it's upgrade is great. In the base game, fission is normally very weak before upgrading it, whereas echo form does everything you need it to to do right away without needing to invest in it further. Buffer is a card that usually needs to be upgraded to provide enough value per energy, especially considering some of the 2X multi hit enemies in the spire. Part of what makes construction form so good is that it's ready to go right out of the box, you never need to upgrade it (which could to some extent be thought of as essentially coming pre-upgraded).",
