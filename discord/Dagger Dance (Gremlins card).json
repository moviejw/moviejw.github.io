      "content": "Incredibly strong AOE and frontloaded option for gremlins, largely because they have so many synergies with multihit cards. They have good access to strength gain (flex, erupt), and they can get multiplicative benefits from wiz. The upgrade is a huge part of what makes this card so powerful, getting a third hit in lets wiz deal 30 AOE damage, which solves basically every AOE fights in the game cleanly. Three hits also goes nuts with strength gain from mad getting hit, flex, relics, and other sources, letting dagger dance perform well even in single enemy fights. You do need to be a bit careful with timing on this card, as 6 (9) damage is pretty weak, but even a single point of strength takes that up to 8 (12), and as an attack, you can also benefit from sneaky and fat gremlins passives as well. \n\nThis starting off as a double hit, and upgrading to a triple hit makes it beat out most of the competition as far as other frontloaded/AOE attacks for gremlins go. They synergy with wiz and strength (which several potions and relics can reliably give you as well) lets it deal massive damage, and have a much higher cieling than most other options that gremlins get. The card is probably too overcentralizing for the character, and I think the upgrade is probably what should be nerfed to help bring it in line. It's a +3 right now, but can very easily be a +13 with wiz, or a +4 (at least) with strength gain. It's likely much safer and healthier to just up the base damage to 3 (5) and not increase the number of hits. Right now, it's not only a great act 1 pickup to deal frontloaded damage, but it can be built around to burst hard enough to still perform effectively well into the later stages of the game.\n\nRunic pyramid is great alongside dagger dance to pair it more effectively with temp strength gain and line it up with wiz. Ways to make multiple wards help charge your wiz up to get the most from dagger dance. Pen nib is devastating when paired when timed correctly with this.",
