      "content": "Usually, I take this to help deal efficient frontloaded damage in act 1, and especially to help deal with hallways/elites in act 2 when you can take it from the act 1 boss card reward. Even if it's just exhausting 2 cards, that's 18 (24) damage for 2 energy, and it can easily be much higher than that. Snecko already starts a run with 2 unidentified starter cards that are offclass, and ascenders bane counts as well. You're often going to be taking a few more offclass cards to trigger snecko soul more often, and to help clear act 1, so this card usually gets supported pretty naturally.  Pairing it with snecko eye or master eye can make it much easier to draw enough cards to more reliably exhaust 3+ cards and nuke down short fights. Randomizing the cost down to 1 or 0 with those and muddle can also really increase the efficiency. You don't really have exhaust synergies inherently, but if you can find some from taking snecko or collector, this gets quite a bit better, and it can at least help remove some ??? cards that roll poorly in a fight in a pinch. Runic pyramid makes doing that much easier, and also lets you hold onto this if you draw it without having offclass cards alongside it.\n\nSnecko doesn't have a particularly strong set of frontloaded damage cards for acts 1 and 2 at lower rarities, so this is often an attractive option to fill that gap, though it is pretty expensive to buy it from a shop. Sometimes you can fill that need by taking and identifying a ??? attack card, but this is usually a much cleaner solution. It's a great tool for solving AOE fights like tri slavers, triple jaw wurm, and triple cultist by quickly taking out one of the enemies very efficiently, and you don't have many other ways to do that as snecko without getting lucky on unidentified cards. The upgrade is a high priority to increase the efficiency even more.",

      "content": "extremely strong attack. The comparison to fiend fire is apt, this card's use case is almost the exact same. Build up a big hand (easy to do wit sneckos draw) and nuke the enemy. A big thing this card has going for it is that it acutally does not exhaust itself; so you can use it several times a fight at the cost of losing a lot of cards. Since a lot of snecko runs go in the \"random bullshit go\" direction rather then relying on a specific plan having a card that exhausts indiscriminately is very welcome in most decks. This card can also be picked much earlier then fiend fire since its damage floor is usually 27 for 2 if you have 2 offclass cards; which is pretty easy to achieve.",
