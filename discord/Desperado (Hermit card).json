      "content": "A simple enough card on your first cycle through the deck, that can have some seriously explosive potential later on in the fight. The upgrade is very powerful, since that +2 becomes a +4, and then a +8, all of which can be further multiplied through vulnerable. Keep in mind that strong as the damage from this is, your deck only has room for so many damage only cards. Early in the run, I will take this and be pretty happy with it, but I don’t usually have room for it once I’m in act 2. The numbers tend to work out pretty favorably on desperado, as 10 damage for 1 energy is solid in short fights, and if a fight is going on long enough for you to reshuffle, then 20 damage for 2 energy and 40 damage for 3 energy are usually reasonable cards to help take down bigger elites and bosses.\n\nIf you have 4 energy, 80 (96 if upgraded) base damage is pretty impressive, and you can of course reduce the cost of this through other methods as well to keep multiplying and accessing the damage. This can include having 5 energy from 2 energy relics, ice cream, lone wolf, eternal form, cheat, itchy trigger, and other forms of energy or cost manipulation. Sometimes you can use desperado as a way to burst down bosses before they get to reach their second stage, like champ or time eater. If a fight goes on long enough and reaches a point where you can’t cast it again, that is a relevant drawback, but you could exhaust it with something like malice or adapt if you need to. Pairs very well with vulnerable since the base damage can become so incredibly high. Snecko eye notably overrides the cost increase, as it will be fully randomized between the costs of 1,2, or 3, every time you draw it, but still multiply the damage dealt. Necronomicon and Pen nib can both be used to devastate enemies with this attack after you reshuffle.",

It's good in a Dead on deck because that deck type usually lacks multihit attacks for big strength payout. It's good in a curse decks because you're usually able to survive long enough to scale it up in damage and get some strength from determination. It's obviously great with any source of cost manipulation, especially <Gambit> witch lets you both scale it's damage and frontload it with potentially getting to play desperado twice on the same turn",
