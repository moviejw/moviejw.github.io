      "content": "It starts out as as simple enough block card that can help you get extra value form your best collectibles, especially scalign ones like powers. As a block card, it also has some natural synergy with things like doom, dark lord form and empower as a way to buy time to let your scaling engines get online. It can so easily become so much more than that if you find some of the better synergy pieces, which is actually fairly likely to happen. Some of the better collectibles to double are ranwid, vagrant, blue slaver, byrd, centurion, darklings, jaw wurm, repulsor, gremlin leader, lagavulin, nemesis, reptomancer, sentry, torch head, and transient. Some of those are rather hard to find, but others are from elites that you are likely to face, or hallway fights that have a good chance to show up. \n\nWhere it gets really strong is how it synergizes with your own card pool. Forgery and Dragon's trove give you a better chance to find really strong cards to double, somber shield lets you float double trouble or a strong collected card for a turn to try and line them up. Brain Drain lets you have more options to use double trouble with, and is incredibly strong against neow to double cast endgame. Greenpyre Locus lets you shuffle in additional options tailored to that fight at hand to increase flexibility. Shadow daggers stacks up faster since you are playing more collected cards per turn than normal. Soulforge and especially dark apotheosis allow you to upgrade your collected cards and get significant extra value from doubling those upgrades, which is massive on the right powers. Omen is perhaps one of the strongest synergies for double trouble, the block buys you time to scale up, and double playing the collected card builds up double the strength, and both cards play well with many of the same synergy pieces.",

      "content": "I think the potential is powerful enough to speculate on this card early, even with few or no synergy pieces yet, and while it's a little weak in act 1 when you have less powerful collected cards to pair it with, and nob punishes this, it's strong enough in the rest of the run to be worth taking as long as you have already covered your frontloaded damage needs early on. Runic pyramid is excellent with this to let you hold onto it until you draw your best cards to double. It enables all the collected card spam payoffs really well, and is particularly good with darklings and gremlin leader to spam even harder. The upgrade is bog standard, not really ever a major priority, but you are going to want to play this card most of the time when you draw it, so the +3 is pretty nice if you can find time for it. Since this does double play the card, it can pair well with ninja relics, pen, nib, ink bottle, six-point brand, and letter opener to get extra procs from them, though it will also sometimes be punished by neow and watcher 3. If anything, the doubling effect and synergies of this card feel strong enough that I think the block value might deserve a small nerf, though it's not absolutely necessary to rebalance this by lowering the value down to 5 (8). Armaments' only blocks for 5 due to the utility it provides, and this provides quite a bit more powerful utility, especially before the upgrade.",
