      "content": "this is defiantly a bottom tier hexaghost card. Its very similar to your starting kindle, only that it extinguishes after igniting and it upgrades to cost 0 rather then being functional on already ingested ghostflames. You already have a card nearly the same as this in your starter deck, making picking it in act 1 nearly useless. Besides its effect of providing an easy ignition is already rather mediocre since even at the start of the game its not partially hard to cycle through all 6 ghost flames and as the game progresses it just gets even easier. I think the idea of this card is that it lets you ignite ghost flames 2, 3 or even 4 times in a row but it directly competes with other cards that do that which are acutally good. Off the top of my head, spectral spark, unlimited power, catch up, bright ritual and instant inferno all also have the roll of providing ether a targeted ghost flame ignite, a targeted ghost flame extinguish or both. While its true that all 5 of those cards cost energy vs this card being potentially 0 hexaghost as a character never has to worry to that much energy management as your whole deck is playing itself for free and so the very real secondary benefits that those cards have over Again! matter much more then the energy cost does.",

      "content": "Rather strange card, as a fairly low impact skill, it's awful in the early game considering both gremlin nob and tri-sentries, and even in hallway fights, paying an energy for an ignition (sometimes double ignition on crushing ghostflames) is not great value since you won't have intensity yet. The reason I bring up act 1 is that this is a common, so you will see it early in the run, and fairly often it will be up against much better cards (sword and shield of night, ghost shield, burning touch, heat metal) that are also much more appropriate at that time in the run. Spending 1 energy to ignite the searing or crushing ghostflame is just not efficient.  I think that the effect of Again! makes more sense to have on an uncommon, since it's relatively niche, and really wants to be supported through good ghostflame positioning with advance/retract as well as some intensity to make igniting the flames more valuable.\n\nIt does become a better card later in the run, as you pick up some of those synergies for it, and as igniting priority ghostflames becomes more relevant in longer scaling fights. Even then though, there are plenty of more generally useful options that allow you to ignite ghostflames multiple times. While the upgrade is fairly nice, hexaghost almost never struggles with energy costs, and so it's not that useful, though it can be good if you have a ton of card draw, and is certainly appreciated if it comes for free from toxic egg or a pre-upgraded version. The non upgraded version is so awkward and niche though that I feel like it's almost never correct to take it, even if you have something like runic pyramid to help line the effect up with priority ghostflames.",
