      "content": "A very strong potion, this usually comes in clutch to block for 12, 16, or even more on crucial turns. Comparing it to block potions guaranteed 12, this comes out very well, though it is uncommon rather than common. Blocking is a really valuable thing for potions to do, since they cost can be deployed at any time in any fight without spending any energy, and preventing chip damage/big hits is critical to letting you take on challenging fights like elites throughout the run safely. Early on in the run (mostly act 1) more proactive potions like fire potion, explosive potion, and attack potion do tend to be more valuable, as most fights are races where dealing damage is more important than blocking, but block potions like this one tend to do very well later in the run as a tool to avoid having a disastrous turn where you are getting attacked for 30+ damage and have drawn little or no block.\n\nDepending on your character and tendecy to take 0 cost cards and energy generation, this potion can get very strong. Anyone who likes to spam cards and can generate cheap resources (gremlins, slime boss, guardian, snecko, silent) can usually get 20 or more block from this somewhat consistently. When you are still at 3 energy, you will still usually get 12, though if you are filling up on 2 and 3 cost cards (not advisable early game), you might only get 8. You can also use armorers tincture as a way to generate block during an infinite, though that is not usually relevant in downfall where you don't have to worry about beat of death or time warp. If my deck has even a few 0 cost cards in it or some spam potential, I would strongly consider buying this from a shop, especially if my block was somewhat inconsistent, or I was heading into a difficult elite fight. Pretty much always happy to get it as a random drop.",
