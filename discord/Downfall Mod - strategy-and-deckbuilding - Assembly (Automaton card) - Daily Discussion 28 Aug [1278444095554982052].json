      "content": "Great rare overall to speed up the process of getting your first reshuffle, putting more functions together faster, and just moving past basics/curses. It's hard to think of a deck that wouldn't be happy to have this, as it's effect is just so universally good (even status focused decks can get encode some cards, move past strikes/defends, and dig deeper towards bug barrage and statuses). Upgrading this lets it potentially fill in multiple functions, which will then be returned to your hand at 1 energy, letting this be incredibly efficient even as it accelerates you. Usually  a very solid upgrade since it lets the card dig deeper. Definitely gets better the more encode cards you have, but even if it's not a super high number, this still works effectively to dig through your deck, and it's not difficult to find more encode cards later on (they make up an enormous amount of the card pool). Even with just the starter deck and first couple draft picks, you have 2 cards with encode, and many of your frontloaded damage cards for early game will also have encode. \n\nTo be fair, automaton has many very solid rares, so this will often have strong competition, but there aren't many ways to get to your first reshuffle this quickly, which is very valuable to start redrawing completed functions. Acceleration is often one of the more valuable things you can have headed towards the late game, in order to make sure you draw your best cards on the right turns, and as often as possible. Getting key powers down in a timely fashion also becomes increasingly important later on.\n\nGets slightly better with runic pyramid in order to get rid of the annoying corner case where you draw this as one of the last cards in your deck and can't make full use of the scry/encode element. Strange spoon is probably not necessary, but could be fun to try and use this a second or third time.",
