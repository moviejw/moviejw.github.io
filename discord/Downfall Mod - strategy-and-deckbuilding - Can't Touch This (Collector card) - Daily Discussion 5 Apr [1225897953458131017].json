      "content": "Most of what you're here for is the dexterity, and it does an adequate job of providing that. You really desperately want the upgrade, as the difference between 1 and 2 is very significant, but it does still perform decently before then. The doom stacking is cute, but it's a very small amount, and really requires being able to keep enemies afflicted in order to start stacking up. I find that this card tends to do really well alongside misdirect, dark lord form, somber shield, double, trouble, mystery weaving, stash away, void armor,  calipers, and billow to some extent. \n\nThere is a good natural synergy between the 2 components of can't touch this, that encourage using it to stall out fights alongside steady affliction. Weak+Dexterity should help mitigate a lot of damage, and you can sit back and let the doom do the work of killing enemies (though you definitely want some ways to stack doom faster). Dark Lord Form in particular plays very well with that strategy. You can also use empower or Omen as the eventual payoff for stalling fights out for a long time with cheap block cards.\n\nOne thing that can make this a weak pickup are the some alternative forms of mitigation available to collector. Temporary HP doesn't scale with this in any way, cursed wail has no synergy, and you have several pretty solid 2+ cost block cards that aren't great with dex scaling. I'm pretty sure I'll take that doesn't scale the stolen block with this card either. If you have a mitigation package largely based on using those methods (relics can also be another form of mitigation that won't scale with this) then you probably want to avoid this card. Collector doesn't have anywhere near the number of synergies with dexterity that silent does (lots of cheap block cards, dodge and roll scaling twice, poison being easier to stack), so this card is often much worse. However dexterity and scaling mitigation are important enough tools over the course of the run that this is still usually quite good.",
