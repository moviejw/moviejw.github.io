      "content": "It plays very well into champs core strength of dominating short and medium length hallway/elite fights. Stunning elites in particular is very significant value, which can help you defeat them with very little health lost. Well worth taking to lock up those matchups and let you farm fights to get more gold/relics.\n\nAlso very on theme for champs overall plan, it won't help you out very much against bosses with their larger health pools and longer fights. It can't stun them, though being an triple attack for vigor and strength is appreciated. Champ always needs to try and find a game plan to deal with boss fights, and many of their best tools, cards, and overall strategies don't work very well against bosses. Long-term damage scaling should always be a very high priority when playing champ, especially when considering the act 4 final boss, which wrecks burst damage strategies.\n\nSince this is a rare and will be up against some of those longer term solutions, you may want to consider skipping it's more immediate value to take the late game scaling options instead, like gladiator form or strike of genius. If you think you can use the stun to get strong enough in the short term and farm elites, then the trade off could be worth it though. Upgrading this to reduce the energy cost is nice, but there are probably higher priority upgrades since this is single use. If you keep it at 2 energy, you can also combo this with necronomicon for double stuns, and snecko eye could make the upgrade irrelevant.",
