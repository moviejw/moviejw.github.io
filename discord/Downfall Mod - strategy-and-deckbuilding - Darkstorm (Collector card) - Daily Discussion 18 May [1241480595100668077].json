      "content": "It starts as 2 energy to deal 12 (16) damage and draw 1 collected card, which is somewhat below rate, but it does shuffle more blightnings into your draw pile to give you explosive turns later in the fight. What is quite nice is the ability to get deeper into your collected deck more quickly, as most of the cards in there should be pretty good, and it can let you find key collected powers (book of stabbing, reptomancer, gremlin nob) faster. The doom stacking can also add up pretty well if you are good at applying afflicted. As a rare, it has some very stiff competition from collectors other generally powerful pool of rares/expensive shop prices, but I have been pretty happy with this card in most decks if I transform into it or it drops from building up rare chance. The explosive potential that this card offers can be nice to end medium length fights faster, and it does offer some limited scaling in longer boss fights.\n\nI don't think I'm super excited to see this, but it usually performs pretty well, and it plays nicely with several relics, like krampian coal, ink bottle, ninja relics, and dead branch (usually an auto win on collector anyways). Cute with strange spoon, though that's not a relic you should be taking on collector. The 0 cost attacks that draw another card also play well with the natural strength gain of the empower, embers, and omen, and the doom stacking can help speed up Dark Lord Form. I think with enough of the right relics/synergies, this can be worth taking over some of the generically strong collector rares. If you have runic pyramid or other draw manipulation, this can lead to some very strong turns if you play it with a very small draw pile. The upgrade is fun, but not that important compared to other upgrades, as the blightnings will all exhaust.",

I would be more interested if it did more to help the frontloaded component of the card. It's definitely fun to chain a bunch of blightning's together and draw tons of collected cards, but outside of synergies with omen, shadow daggers, feel my pain, and having more options for double trouble, I don't think it's as impactful as other collector upgrades.",

      "content": "this card used to be a snap pick, when Omen was completely overpowered and just let you spam collected cards to win. Now, well it still works for same strategy; instead granting 3(5) strength instead of 50 aoe damage. A downgrade for sure but Omen strategies are still pretty strong because of the power of collectable cards. Even without omen to scale dark storm can also be a good pick up in a normal deck if it has 8 or so collectable cards it wants to draw. Although its more situational that way since its a rare card that wants to slot into an existing deck making it hard to find when you want it.",

Playing machine learning or brutality draws an extra card every turn, making you stronger than you normally would be on those turns, and darkstorm does the same thing, but in a strictly limited capacity based on the number of blightnings it generates (you could argue that predator or evaluate also provides limited linear scaling). To be fair, collected cards are usually much stronger than normal cards (and drawing them is much more valuable, since you only get 1 per turn naturally), so getting access to them faster is great. I do think that darkstorm is a powerful card, it just has some very stiff competition.",
