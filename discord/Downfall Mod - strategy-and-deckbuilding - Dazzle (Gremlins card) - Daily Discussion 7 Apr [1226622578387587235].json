      "content": "Very fitting card for gremlins, exactly the kind of silly and fun flavor that I like to see for them, and the beta art is fantastic. On the practical side, you can only steal things that are actually there, so there are a reasonable number of enemies that this doesn't do very much against, but even in fights where it's effect doesn't work, it still exhausts itself, and you can of course choose to use your wiz on something else. And in the fights where it's effect does work (which can be increased through philo stone, and through patience, as many enemies do have moves that eventually buff their own strength assuming you are playing a slower deck) it's enormously powerful, combining disarm with inflame, and a nice burst of front-loaded damage. Gremlins especially appreciate the strength down if you are trying to play a more defensively oriented deck (admittedly that is quite rare for them) since they are particularly punished by multi-hit attacks being able to kill multiple gremlins at once and cause death spirals. \n\nGets much better if you are focusing on gremlin wizard, and can be pretty difficult to time correctly if you aren't. Runic pyramid makes this much easier to land, both in terms of waiting for certain enemies to gain strength, and playing it with 3 wiz. This can be particularly useful in boss fights, most of which have strength of some kind, and reward the scaling elements of the card. Upgrade is not a priority.",

      "content": "I have very mixed feelings about this card. Its raw value of doing 9 damage and stealing 2 strength is pretty good; it serves as damage mitigation over time thats not useless in hallway fights since it raises your damage too. But dazzle has pretty bad damage for an attack that needs wiz to activate. The average gremlin wizard attack is doing 40+ damage for just 1 energy; dazzle does half of that. Its pretty realistic to just use the other attacks in your deck to ohko your enemies in 1 turn and never need to use dazzle. However dazzle can play a big role in boss fights; where reducing the bosses strength can make a big difference in most of them. However bosses get one shot by flurry; usually on turn 1 too. But thats flurry its the strongest card in gremlins kit and you cannot rely on finding it every run. This means that dazzle has its place in gremlin wizard decks, but its a card that it feels like your using because you have to rather then you wanting to.",

      "content": "This card just seems weird to me. If you're focusing on wizard, you don't really need to gain 2 strength offensively since you're not spamming attacks (at least less so than other gremlins). What you need is to spend your wiz on an attack that hits several times. If you're not completely focused on wiz, it won't work reliably. It's a bit better in longer boss fights which is admittedly where the gremlins need the most help, but not enough that you can just ignore it being unhelpful in normal fights.\n\nDefensively of course reducing incoming damage is always helpful, but by design it'll only work against enemies who can get it back. So you won't be reducing anyone to actual harmlessness. Against a large portion of hallway and elite fights, it just fizzles.\n\nI feel like wizard needs to be a bit more selective about what he spends his wiz on than this.",
