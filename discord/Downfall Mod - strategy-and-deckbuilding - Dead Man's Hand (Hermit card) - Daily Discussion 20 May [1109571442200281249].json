      "content": "This largely functions like a much harder to use seek, with a very different upgrade, that grabs more cards with less control. Whenever I see this, I look at my rarest cards to understand what it is likely to get, and briefly glance over my uncommons. The upgrade is pretty important, since you fetch your 3 rarest cards, you'd really like to have enough energy left to afford playing as many of them as you can. Very useful with engine powers like adapt, eternal form, fatal desire, or in hopefully very rare cases, high noon. Can lead to some explosive turns with overwhelming power and gambit. Beyond that, your rares aren't great to tutor out, with dissolve, final canter, heroic bravado, purgatory, and roundhouse kick being okay in some spots, and pretty bad in others.\n\nNotably dead or alive, from beyond, magnum, and roughhouse are pretty bad pulls, as some of those cards want to be played later in a fight, and others are awkward with 3 cards in your hand. Reprieve can also be awkward if it's not a good turn to spend energy on it. \n\nNow, you do have more control than you think here. You can check your draw pile, you can draft differently to alter your rarest cards. Sometimes, you will know that this isn't the right turn to play your rarest cards, and you just don't play dead man's hand. I think it absolutely has its niche, as some decks really want to get eternal form or fatal desire down quickly, and this can help with that. There are some very good uncommon cards that are also good to tutor out, though your ability to do that is fairly contextual on when you draw dead man's hand, and what other rares/uncommons are still in your draw pile. Deadeye, flash powder, grudge, gestalt, maintenence+, shadow cloak, and smoking barrel can all be important to find early/on specific turns. \n\nThis card is extremely contextual, and you have to pick it on a case by case basis. To be fair, it has basically no competition, just a handful of card draw effects that can't be as specific.",

It's both good and bad with runic pyramid, since you'll be discarding more cards, but can afford to hold onto some of those rares and powers to play them on more favorable turns. It's very weird with snecko eye, since the cards are added to your hand, the costs won't be randomized. You also probably aren't casting this when it costs more than 1, since you won't be able to play the follow-up cards. Can be good with dead-on cards, though they need to be cheap enough to cast, and your rares will likely block you from tutoring them.",
