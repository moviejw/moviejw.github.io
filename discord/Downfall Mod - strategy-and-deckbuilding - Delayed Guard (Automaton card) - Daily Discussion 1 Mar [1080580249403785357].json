      "content": "Many of the silent cards that are delayed by a turn suffer from the fact that next turn can be a very long time away, especially when you are being attacked now for 20+ damage. Taking that kind of chip damage in hallway/elite fights is an easy way to lose a run, as those cards are effectively curses on the turn you draw them, and even if their effect is strong, you are paying a huge cost to get access to it next turn. Dodge and Roll works pretty well because it at least has some impact this turn, and scales twice with dexterity, flying knee is pretty functional as an act 1 damage card with a small upside, but is not exciting by any means. Outmaneuver tends to be atrocious, and really needs help from something like runic pyramid, well laid plans, or very good X cost cards like malaise to make it remotely viable. Predator is a very strong act 1 damage card, and even plays well with snecko eye, but that's more because of the high damage output on a character that struggles to turn energy into damage in the early game. The delayed card draw is a welcome bonus, but not really the reason you pick predator on silent. Doppleganger can be very strong with a chem X, but it can feel like a curse until you get it upgraded, and even then it is often too slow at its job, and costs you chip damage. Nightmare can be run winning in boss fights with the right cards to copy, but will often cost you health in hallway fights. Phantasmal Killer is in a very weird spot where it can be a reasonable way to close fights out quicker, but it also desperately needs an upgrade, and even then will cost you in the short term of the fight.",

They can also benefit from the boat relics (anchor, horn clean, captain's wheel), which can help cover their downside during those early turns.",

      "content": "I just don't think the reward is worth the risk for delayed guard. The upside is that I can get a small amount of block next turn? I suppose it can help complete a sequence cheaply and let you cast it on the same turn, getting some frontloading that way, but then you have a sequence where 1/3rd of it is a really weak card, and you could have achieved frontloading just as easily by putting a better card in your deck than this. Most of the time in slay the spire, you need to block now, before you take that 20+ damage, because your health carries over between fights. Putting delayed guard into your deck largely feels like adding a curse to me, on the same level as outmaneuver. You don't even get anywhere near as as strong of a payout, because outmaneuver can at least be very strong with malaise and some card spam strategies when you get pyramid/well laid plans. Automaton doesn't have very much card manipulation, and pretty much only has access to runic pyramid to try and line this effect up, making it even worse than silent's package of delayed cards. This is one of the few cards for automaton that I think is close to unpickable because of how bad the risk/reward is.",

Automation has a lot of card draw and this 0 cost encode can be used to create functions more quickly which is always good because pretty much every possible function is sustainably better then any normal 1 cost card. Often you can rely on Block chain to create whats effectively a free barricade which makes the delayed block on this card much better when you can keep it for when its needed; 7 block for zero is pretty huge as well.",
