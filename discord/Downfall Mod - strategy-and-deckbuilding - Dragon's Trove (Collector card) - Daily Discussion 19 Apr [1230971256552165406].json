      "content": "This card is incredibly good, even after a well deserved nerf. I think it is in a good place balance wise, but I am still very tempted to buy this every time a see it at a shop, and to snap pick it over other rares at boss rewards. Part of that comes from reserves being an extremely powerful mechanic (the upgrade is quite high priority, really helps accelerate and smooth your plays), and part of it comes from existing support for spamming collected cards (shadow daggers, omen, feel my pain). Yet another part is that your collected cards will often be stronger than your regular cards, and you only get to naturally draw 1 per turn. Dragon's Trove significantly accelerates the process of finding your best collected cards, and can help set up certain powers and scaling effects very effectively. It's difficult to overstate just how much better reserves are than energy, AND just how much better drawing collected cards is than drawing normal cards.\n\nAnother thing to note is that collected already tends to be a monster in terms of late game scaling. I basically always feel sure that if I can get to turn 6+ of a fight, I will have solved it through scaling (defect does this to a lesser extent as well). That means that having strong early turns and being able to get extra output to safely deploy scaling and buy time for it to stack up is very valuable, and Dragon's Trove is the perfect card for that. Gets even better with ink bottle or letter opener as a cheap skill that enables playing even more cards. The only real downside to this card is that sometimes you won't be able to play all of the best cards in your hand+the cards it draws you, but upgrading it tends to fix that, and you can do so at the campfire that starts the next act. It can also be an awkward card to bottom deck if you have a very small collected deck (6 or less cards, which you can be incentivized to do), but you're still getting 1(2) reserves for 0 energy 1 card, and you could have krampian cole.",
