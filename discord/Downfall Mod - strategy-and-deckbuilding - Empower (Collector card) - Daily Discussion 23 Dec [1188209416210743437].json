      "content": "I really like this card, it's effect is so useful for going over the top of bosses/longer fights and scaling your damage up. Sure, collector has Dark Lord Form and Omen as well, but those are rares that you won't necessarily see every run. Taking an empower also means that you are free to grab other rares over DLF and Omen, like the incredibly powerful Whomp, Dragons trove, and Protecting Call.  Collector also has numerous good options for paying off strength (jaded jabs, wildfire, shadow daggers) that make an effect like this matter in fights faster than it would initially appear. Having empower in the card pool means that your odds of finding a way to outscale bosses/the late game gauntlet is much higher than normal, which means you can build your deck accordingly and focus more on mitigation/frontloading. I basically never worry about finding a way to deal enough damage to bosses as collector because of this (even if you're truly desperate, you could use embers through fleeting embers and sunbloom kindling), which really frees up the deck building process, and makes taking block cards earlier in the run feel much better.\n\nHaving reserves/chem X also means it's really easy for you to just cast this once and solve an entire fight if you can block well. Giant head, several act 3 fights involving enemies with lots of health, and most fights against non-scaling enemies fold to this card. Sure, it's slow to get going, but the multiplicative effect of the extra turns means you can end fights quickly once you've gotten the strength. The upgrade is particularly nice to enhance this part of the card (though often not necessary). Being able to have just a single card in your deck solve so many fights is very valuable to me (very similar to demon form, but this doesn't have to cost 3, and isn't rare). I actually think that taking blind chem X is correct on collector, because of how good it is with both empower and stash away, which as uncommons, aren't that hard to find.",
