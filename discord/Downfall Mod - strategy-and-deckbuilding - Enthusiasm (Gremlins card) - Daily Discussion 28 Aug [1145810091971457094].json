      "content": "I don't use this card very often but I completely understand why people regard it so highly. This card has the potential to draw a lot of cards per turn as long as your deck is able to swap gremlins enough and since drawing cards is your reward for doing so you get to draw into more cards that let you swap more.; fortunately the best cards for swaping gremlins all cost zero. This power gets really strong when stacked, having 2 enthusiasm in play enables some of the easiest gremlin infinites and not unlike watcher's rushdown your getting an infinite thats not a large commitment to create (vs something like making a heel hook infinite which risks sinking the entire run before you can pull it off). The downside of enthusiasm is that you need to have seen it early (because it is good enough to take on floor 2)  or already have enough pieces in your deck that work with it for it to really be used. Often I find that gremlins tend to not want to swap very often, since your drafting cards that work together and cards with synergy are usually only working with 1 or 2 gremlins at a time rather then all of them. Its the main reason I favor boss swap on gremlins every run since it removes variance at the start of your fights and lets you stay on one gremlin forever if you wish.",

      "content": "Enthusiasm is an extremely powerful engine card that can really facilite the card spam synergies for gremlins, and can also be used in infinite setups. Costing 2 energy is pretty rough, and upgrading it to reduce the cost is a fairly high priority so that it's easier to get in play and less clunky. It is notable that gremlins don't have access to very many card draw tools (raid usually being your best), which means that enthusiasm goes up in value as a way to fill that gap. It also gets a lot better if you have some way to offset the cost, like mummified hand, idol of retromation, or revel. The effect is excellent, the main downside is finding a way to get it into play smoothly, and you can even draw cards with it on the turn you play it, since most of the swap cards cost 0. Gets much better once you have 4 energy so that you can take advantage of that same turn draw.\n\nKeep in mind that you do need to make a decision relatively early in the run (before getting halfway through act 2 usually) about whether you want to support just 1 or 2 specific gremlins, or lean into swap synergies and play a less focused deck with more generic value cards in it. Enthusiasm is not a great card in the first type of deck, but it can be a reasonable speculative pick early in the run, as the swap synergies are very well supported, and the card draw is always appreciated with the very large number of cheap/card spam synergies gremlins have. I personally tend to lean towards decks focusing on just 1 or 2 gremlins, but enthusiasm is certainly a strong incentive/payoff for being a swap deck, and can pair very well with conga line.\n\nQuite bad into 2 of the act 1 elites, and definitely too expensive for early game hallway fights. Gremlins can still get away with taking it early since they tend to have very strong burst damage, but it is somewhat risky. A much more reasonable pick as you head towards the act 2 boss and beyond, and really shines in the late game gauntlet. Great with snecko eye",
