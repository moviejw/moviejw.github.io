      "content": "The effect is definitely cool, and it's a ton of damage that can even be sustained via affliction, but it is asking quite a lot out of you. Getting and keeping 4 energy worth of reserves just to even be able to cast this is a fairly large ask, even if you can create some kind of recurring bludgeon. Sure, you have pyromancy and stash away as ways to stockpile large amounts of them, but outside of that most sources only give 1 reserve. I just don't think the payoff is worth the effort here, as there are plenty of ways to put a good chunk of doom on an enemy that don't require you to go through all these hoops. On a side note, what is doom for? It's effectively a scaling source of damage, kind of like poison, but it can fall off if you lose affliction. You know what else is a scaling source of damage? Omen and empower (and Dark Lord Form which is also a way of stacking doom). All of those ask much less of you, and are far more reliable to cast. I just don't think collector struggles enough with scaling damage to ever need to take a card with this much inconsistency. Finger of Death is in direct competition with an absolutely phenomenal cast of rares from collector as well, including omen and dark lord form, as well as very efficient tools like whomp, dragon's trove, darkstorm, fiend fire, protecting call, and pyromancy.\n\nIt's entirely possible that when you see this card from the act 1 boss reward, you might not even be able to make 4 reserves yet, and you are definitely heading into the very challenging act 2 where dead cards get punished extremely hard. If you see it later, you might have the right support for it, but the damage it offers may also no longer be valuable. It's probably at it's best with snecko eye to reduce the cost (snecko is basically a free win for collector anyway though because of the cost of their cardpool). You can also pair it with runic pyramid to get rid of some of the inconsistency issues, at that point it's just slow.",
