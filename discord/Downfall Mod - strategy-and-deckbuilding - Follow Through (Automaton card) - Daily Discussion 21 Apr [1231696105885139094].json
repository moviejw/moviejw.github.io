      "content": "This is an odd card. I don't generally mind that many automaton functions end up being better iron waves, as long as there is some room to do other interesting things. I don't think it's ideal for the character, and it doesn't really represent their identity as either an act 2 boss designed around hyper beam, or as a coder/programmer that the mechanics names seems to be pointing to. What's bizzare is this card leaning into the iron wave identity and doubling down on it, the last thing that automaton needs is more iron waves in the card pool.\n\nAs an effect, it's also quite strong, since building and playing functions is already something you are rewarded for doing, and is represented in your starter deck. How many automaton decks realistically aren't trying to play a function every turn? Even in the status based runs, you still have your starter cards, and the strength/dex from it's a feature still pairs very well with building iron waves. It's very strange to see a card reward you for doing something you basically always want to do anyways, is easy to trigger, is inherently strong, and that the rewards you with more of what you are already doing. The energy efficiency is very powerful too, getting more overall output than dash on a cheaper card. It also gives you more output than actual iron wave, even if you don't trigger the condition. Upgrade is also very strong, a +4 to output even if you don't meet the condition, and a +8 if you do.\n\nEven easier to trigger with runic pyramid, great with ninja relics and ink bottle to double trigger them. Any sources of strength or dex pair quite well with this, but were already good with functions anyways. This card is just very strategically uninteresting. It's rawly efficient, and doesn't change the way you build your deck in any significant way.",
