      "content": "I'm always thrilled to see this in the early game. It does respectable damage, gives you better/faster access to your collected pile, lets you duplicate powerful collected cards, and gives you something extra to do with your reserve energy. Collector definitely needs to add some frontloaded damage cards to patch up their elite matchups in act 1, and this one does the job while not just transitioning gracefully into lategame, but actually offering very powerful utility throughout the whole run. It's especially nice as a way to spam additional collected cards to scale up omen, shadow daggers, and feel my pain. There are even a decent number of early collected cards that cost 1 or 0 energy, so you can often get good value out of the card draw in the early game, and it's great to be able to spend energy on things other than strikes/defends. Ashen strike, inevitable demise, hurting, and I'll take that deal a bit more damage, but have far less utility for later in the run, and I think the tradeoff is usually in forgeries favor.\n\nThere are notably several very strong collected cards to draw early and get a second copy of. These include basically all the powers, most of the 0 cost cards, merchant, centurion, darklings, louse, red slaver, gremlin leader, thieves, lagavulin, nemesis, sentry, and transient. Forgery also lets you pick between 2 (3) collected cards from your pile, so it even has additional flexibility to let you pick the best card for the current situation. The upgrade is very nice later in the run to give it additional flexibility, and can help you pick out your absolute best collected cards to copy more often. Usually, you should have better, more damage focused options to pick in the early game, so I would avoid upgrading it then.",
