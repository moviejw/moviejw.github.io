      "content": "I have found this relic to be really useful. It does retain the card at random, but you have some ability to control the selection based on how you play out your turn (sometimes you can play everything but the card you want to hold, sometimes you can simply cast an expensive card that you don't want to keep, using discard to get rid of an option you don't want, usually you can at least find a line that gives you a good shot at keeping the card you want). Well-Laid Plans is one of the most useful cards in the base game to help you line up the right tool (card) with the right job (turn), and this isn't that far off from being a relic that gives you 1 stack of WLP at the start of every fight, without having to draw it or pay any energy for it. It's also a shop relic, which means that it will usually be pretty affordable (between 157 and 173 gold at A16+) for the utility of the effect you're getting. Even if it doesn't necessarily let you hold the exact right card, just having an extra option into next turn, consistently letting you have 6 options to use on any given turn rather than 5 still lets you have the right card for the right turn more often than normal.\n\nAt it's absolute best when you have really expensive cards that are situational. Also great with expensive powers that you can't afford to spend your whole turn casting when you're being attacked for a lot of damage, but that you want to cast later in the fight (Many form cards, some requiring an upgrade to remove ethereal). You will want to avoid certain cards that are expensive, but straightforward, clunky, or weak. Cards like ragnarok, bludgeon, and rainbow will just get in the way of holding other cards that can be more useful to retain and soemtimes force awkward uses of energy to get the most out of the relic. It's not really a big deal, as you usually don't want to include those types of cards anyways.",

      "content": "I've used this quite a bit on hermit, and it's very good to help hold expensive cards between turns and wait for the right moment to play them. Being able to wait for a safe turn to play expensive powers like adapt, brawl, or eternal form+ is very handy. You can line up dissolve or roundhouse kick with the right turn to get the most out of them. Being able to hold no holds barred until after minions have been spawned in certain fights, or until the last turn of a fight to avoid the drawback, or until you've drawn virtue to remove the debuff is a great bit of utility. You can hold manifest until a turn where you need to focus on blocking, or save spite until a turn where it can exhaust unplayable cards and you need to block. Being able to hold card draw like spite and especially roulette is very valuable with a fuel canister, even more so when paired with shadow cloak. You get to have them in your back pocket to draw extra cards on any turn where you need to get extra block. The roulette interaction is especially good, since the canister consistently gives you an extra card in your hand, letting roulette dig even deeper than normal. Holding any card is good with roulette to draw more cards later, and even when the canister is only letting you hold onto a strike or defend, that still gives you more tools to work with next turn, and cards to discard to covet and body armor, or exhaust with adapt. It can have some difficult moments where you are holding multiple expensive cards, which makes it hard to predict what it will keep for the next turn, though you can play one of them to make that clearer. I have had a lot of success buying this relic and I think it has a lot of good interactions with hermits’ cards.",
