      "content": "Hey there. Where do you guys feel the powerlevel of the gremlins is at right now ? \nI've been trying to pull the A20 triple key run, but i seem to encounter the same problems a lot of the time. Either the run goes extremely smooth with no problem and a single bad hand kills me, or i fail to actually collect enough pieces to tinker a working combo.\n\nHere are my usual strategies :\n-Almost always upgrade Tag Team at first campfire\n-Been ignoring most Strenght synergy cards for a long time. Tried to pick them up, and i don't think i will again\n-Heckle decks are the most resistant i feel like, but they fall short of having heckle be a relic or innate power, and most of these runs end on a fight that doesn't allow to set heckle up and just ends turn 3-4 when unlucky\n-Wiz feels unrewarding most of the time. I try to always combo it with Cat Scratches, Dagger dances or some form of flurry, but overall i don't really feel like that part of the kit is working very well.\n-Make sure to almost always pick Show of Hands, Glittering Barrier, Glimmer and Counter Strike to get some Ward action\n-I feel like going the Sneaky Shiv route is actually optimal, but a lot of the time the deck just feels too squishy and combo oriented. With Flurry, Sharpen Blades and Second Volley you can destroy almost anything, but if you don't get the combo in the first turn or 2nd you're pretty much done\n\nWhat would your advice / strategy tips be as far as Gremlins A20 is concerned ?",

      "content": "swap: \n<Enthusiasm> is deadass the character's best card and makes every other card here win the game for you a la watcher's rushdown, literally take 2 or 3 and win the game with no trouble\n<Patsy> is the most boring swap card, but it can get pretty good once you get enthusiasm. Deflect is nice but if you don't benefit from swapping it can be a nusiance in your hand\n<Tricksy> draws 4(6) cards for 1 at common which is incredible, but discarding non-attacks drawn with it can be detrimental if you aren't careful. The discard is usually pretty bad but it interacts favorably with <shank stone> and <Tag Teamwork>, cards discarded affected by tag teamwork will draw additional cards letting you draw non-attacks off of tricksy. Tricksy is a rare draw card that performs best in act 1, but depending on how you build your deck it may or may not fall off\n<Glitter Guard> is a very powerful block card, much like tricksy it's pickable in act 1 but unlike tricksy its probably going to be good for the entire run. Without anything else going for it it block 10 for 1 unupgraded and switches you to the guy who is really good at blocking, and with other synergies it only gets better\n<bulk up> and <Irritability> are a touch worse as block cards, but the temp hp and thorns are just icing on the cake of switching to fat and mad gremlin. If your deck wants better access to those gremlins they are nice, but they don't do as much as the other common swap cards at 1 on their own.\n<Tadah!> is a very good swap card when interacting with swap synergies, and it can be good on its own too, especially upgraded. As I said earlier I think wizard is the best gremlin, so swapping to him for 0 and possibly helping you towards stacking the wiz is very helpful, I think the first Tadah! is almost always pickable. Most gremlin skills are very good, especially on the wizard gremlin, so I usually get a lot of mileage out of this card.",

      "content": "<Rhythm> is the one and only conventional swap card outside of common, and its pretty good upgraded. Gremlin dance is a very good card to find at 0, and being able to seek Tag Team is about as good. Unless you can line up sneaky gremlin with gremlin dance it's pretty unexciting without swap synergies, but with swap synergies it's a prime infinite enabler and about as good as deck manipulation cards get.\n<Tag Team> is obviously a starter card and is obviously pretty broken, espcially with the Tag Teamwork relic. it kind of just does the job of most of the cards up there but better\n<Party Stick> is a card that needs a few of the other cards here to work, but it is one of the character's 2 reusable energy cards and can potentially net you infinite energy without even needing to play it. It's very good, but entirely reliant on other cards to do anything.\n<Conga Line> and <Scatter> are fine cards, but they don't interact well enough with the other cards here for me to consider them swap synergies",

I used to play a run a pretty agressive strategy where i would try and focus on my usefull grems, and sometimes not even bother rezing them or trading them away to elitese, but now that i play Revel and Raid more often i can defo say keeping everyone in good shape is definetely worth it, if only for these two. Oh and also, to stay alive haha.\nI will have to try the swap synergy build. I may actually have never attempted it. Btw just died to Neow on a Sneaky/Shield kunai run, couldn't get enough momentum to hit her for her last 300 hp. I was punished for my lack of draw as the curses really mess up your hands, revel timings, etc.",

      "content": "Update : I finally beat Neow by going infinite with Enthusiasm on my first A20run ever picking it. Even without party stick it was pretty stupid, but once i got it near the end of act 2 and got it i just went infinite on most of the elites, the two bosses and the three heroes of act 4. I must say going uninentionally infinite makes it pretty tricky to maintain, as you have to empty your hand constantly with low energy costing cards to be able to draw the next swap card, and you always have a risk of ending the combo if you empty your hand too much and end up drawing the bad sequence of cards. \nIt was very fun, but also soooooo tedious  to go infinite every fight and have to cycle through the deck for that one gremlin dance or wiz proccing attack. I loved playing with enthusiasm, but maybe infinite turns is too much for mere gremlins like us. Maybe the combo always was...  the cards we drew along the way",
