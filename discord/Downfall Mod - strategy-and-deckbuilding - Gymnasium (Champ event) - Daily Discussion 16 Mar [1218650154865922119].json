      "content": "This is a really solid event to find, and all 3 options are reasonable in different circumstances. Spar is the greediest/most powerful in the long run if you get through the early game well enough (which champ very often excels in already). You can build some very strong combos that way, and help improve the quality of your late game deck, and be able to support having more finishers if you want to.\n\nCardio is definitely tempting, especially because gaining max HP also increases your current hp. Many act 1 events and all of the elite fights are based around trading health to get stronger in the long run, so having more to work with lets you get further ahead. The only thing I would say is that champ is often so powerful in act 1 that you may not even need that extra chunk of health, and you tend to have such a tough time scaling into the late game that spar is probably more valuable to build a better deck overall. If you have lost a large chunk of health and have some elites coming up you would like to take though, there is definitely value in taking cardio. Just keep in mind that Champ doesn't really have much of a way to capitalize on max HP (healing like reaper, self repair, or long term scaling like demon form, creative ai, and echo form).\n\nLift is fine, vajra is never a relic I'm unhappy to have, and champ does have a decent number of multi-hit attacks that can get value out of the strength multiple times. I just don't really think that champ really needs to worry about their ability to end short hallway fights, and that's where most of the value of vajra comes from. The utility offered by the other options will usually be more valuable in the long run, but if you did want extra power in the early game (perhaps an aggressive 4 elite path, maybe you had a weird double transform from your heart bonus) this is a reasonable option to take.",

Spar is interesting but since this is an act 1 event its quite rare that you have a card that wants to use it that is also better then a free relic.",

      "content": "From my understanding, there are several factors at play in terms of ? rooms vs hallway fights, but by default it is much better to take hallway fights. You get guaranteed rewards in the form of gold and card rewards, and build up both rare chance and potion chance as you take on more fights. ? rooms are extremely high variance, and do also get a significant nerf once you hit A15. In act 2, this dynamic changes, because it has some of the strongest events in the base game, and most act 2 hallway fights at A17+ are almost as difficult as the elite fights. I do think that most of the time though, in both acts 1 and 3, you would lean towards hallway fights more. Something else to consider is how high your potion and rare chance are near the end of an act. Since the boss rare card reward resets your rare chance regardless of how high it was, you want to seek out additional hallway fights near the end of an act if you haven't seen a rare yet. Having a particularly high potion chance and an empty slot can also make you want to do the same thing to make the boss fight easier.\n\nSeveral cards and relics can impact this as well. At a baseline, there are quite a few relics that make hallway fights much easier than they normally would be. Many of these are relics that bolster your turn 1 or early turns in general (Anchor, Lantern, Akabeko, Bag of Preperation, Bag of Marbles, thread and needle, fossilized helix, etc). If you have enough of those relics and something like burning blood or bird faced urn, you might take extra hallway fights to try and heal off of them. You might also do this if you have reaper+strength gain, or self repair+echo form, or you might have metascaling cards like feed, lesson learned, or genetic algorithm that benefit from taking as many fights as possible. Most Relics that make your gold more efficient (Smiling Mask, membership card, courier) also benefit more from fights than ? rooms, since you are guaranteed to get some gold to work with.",

Face of the cleric, Golden idol, and Nloths gift don't come up very often, but they also all make hallway fights better to take.\n\nOn the other hand, relatively few things make ? rooms better than normal. Juzu Bracelet is actually a net negative most of the time, because of the factors that tend to make fights better than events. Tiny chest is awkward because it takes a really long time to pay off, and is basically never worth buying. Ssserpents head is one of the few major rewards for ? rooms, but is locked behind a low chance at a specific event. Cursed Key can make finding chests (one of the best rewards from ? rooms) quite awkward as well. Slavers collar does make you worse at hallway fights, and that, as well as other factors that might make you strong in elite/boss fights but weak in hallway fights are a reason to seek out ? rooms (decks with poor early turns, powerful scaling, some way to easily beat certain bosses like champ/time eater). One other reason to seek out ? rooms is to try and find an emergency merchant if there isn't one on a more convenient path, though it only starts at a 3% chance, increasing by 3% for each non-merchant ? room. I think that the biggest reason to take ? rooms over hallway fights is because you are not in a good position to deal with the dangers of hallway fights, but most decks in that situation are probably not looking at a good chance to win the run overall anyways.",
