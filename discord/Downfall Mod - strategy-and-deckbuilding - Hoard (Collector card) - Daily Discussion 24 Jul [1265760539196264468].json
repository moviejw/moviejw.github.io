      "content": "This is really strong. Burning pact is excellent for ironclad, and this is very close to being the same card, with the retain being the difference. You might not necessarily want to retain the cards you draw, and it could lead to hand clog issues, but a reasonable amount of the time, the retain should be beneficial. You draw 6 cards every turn by default as collector, and embers also have retain, so that would be the main reason that holding the 2 or 3 cards could be bad, though this having pyre does help ease that issue.\n\nPutting aside the differences between the 2 for a second though, burning pact is such a strong card, both as a way to find your best cards faster, and to thin you deck down to scale over time, and potentially set up infinites. Hoard does all those same things too, though collector doesn't really need to look for infinites to win considering the power level of their average cards and mechanics. Thinning the deck down of strikes/defends, as well as triggering kindling's and embers is great value to have alongside the ability to find the right cards at the right time. Collector doesn't have tools like dark embrace or feel no pain that can make exhausting extra valuable (feel my pain is alright, but doesn't really pay you off in the same way) so this is perhaps a little worse relative to how well the character can abuse in. \n\nSoulforge, collectors strike, and dragon's trove can all draw/play extra cards, but only from the collected pile. Oakbrim kindling can let you draw extra cards, but does need to be drawn alongside a way to exhaust it. That means that hoard has some extra value due to relative scarcity on the character. There aren't many reliable ways to draw extra cards from your main deck, so having this one to get to your scaling powers/mitigation faster is more useful. The card draw matters more and is easier to afford spending energy on in acts 3 and 4, to access your best tools. Upgrade is quite good to dig deeper, especially in the lategame",

While hand clock is a concern for this character; its not unreasonable to play around hoard retaining cards. You can simply just play some of the the cards you just drew. Or use collector's various sources of pyre to remove them. Sometimes you really cannot effectively stop hoard from clogging your hand though, but thats fairly uncommon and you can opt to just not take hoard in those rare circumstances. In many runs, card draw is premium especially on collector who has such great energy generation.",

Also it's card draw, which you usually only play when you have spare energy, so play the cards drawn? I feel like if this alone is what clogs your hand then I feel like that can be avoided by playing cards in the right order. The issue I see is this with <somber shield>, an extremely strong reliable card that can also cause next turn hand clog.",

I guess if you have something like coffin nail or a ton of somber shields this can be a bit unappealing, but that is also the worst case scenario for the card. Alternatively if you start this sequence with 2+ embers and only pyre one and the card is upgraded you hit the hand cap, but once again I think that you're just playing the card wrong if you are in this scenario.",
