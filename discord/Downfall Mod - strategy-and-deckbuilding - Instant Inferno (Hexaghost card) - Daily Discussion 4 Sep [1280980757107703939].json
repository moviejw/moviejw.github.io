      "content": "Definitely at it's best early on in the turn to help frontload damage quickly, especially if you are very good at setting up soulburn on turn 1 (for the earliest possible detonation) and/or have phantom fireball (hopefully upgraded) to let you cash in on the soulburn damage early. It can deal an impressive amount of damage for just 1 energy, especially if either of those two things are true. Most non-boss fights don't last long enough for you to get around the wheel traditionally and benefit from having all the flames lit as you get a huge inferno ghostflame off. If you have a lot of advance and ways to ignite flames faster than normal, you can change that dynamic, but most of the time, instant inferno acts as a way to let you finish shorter fights and get as much damage as possible from the inferno ghostflame without having to go around the whole wheel. If you are using it as burst damage, you will want to pay extra attention to lighting as many flames as possible during the early turns (a good practice generally anyways) to get the most possible damage from the inferno ghostflame. Make sure that you are taking cheap attacks, especially ones like nightmare strike and strike from beyond that can make it easier to trigger the searing ghostflame on turn 1.\n\nBeing able to double ignite the inferno ghostflames is also a really useful function of the card, shared by a few other cards in your pool at lower rarities like kindle and haunting echo. I wouldn't necessarily take instant inferno just for that aspect of it, but the retain does make it much easier to land it when you want the extra damage in boss fights and other long fights.\n\nUpgrade is an impressive +9, but it both exhausts itself, and the damage is delayed as soulburn. If you have the two ways mentioned earlier to cash in on that bonus damage easier, it's a very nice upgrade, but otherwise it can be risky due tot he delayed component, and it being single use.",
