      "content": "It's kind of risky to use this. Purposefully staying under half health puts you in danger of dying/getting extremely low after 1 bad turn once you're up to act 2 elites and beyond. On the other hand, it's completely dead if you never fall below half health (which then, like with black wind, tends to put you in a situation where the card does start to perform better). I just really don't like the idea of putting a card in your deck that only works when you are falling behind. It's especially awkward when you consider that both this and black wind are rares, which means you have to either pay a lot of gold/souls for them, or take them over other, more proactive rares at a boss card reward. There's also the risk that you do play most of the run at under half health to support this, but then it gets stuck near the bottom of your deck in a fight (very likely to happen at least a few times over the course of the run), and you don't even get rewarded for playing so dangerously.\n\nFor what it's worth, yes 6 strength for 1 (0) is a very efficient deal, and the debuff removal can also be used to good effect if you can time it well (Though I can't think of many big debuffs champ puts on himself). Champ also has several multihits that make good use of the strength gain. The effect is also very flavorful for champ based on his original moveset from base game. I think it can be worth taking if you have extremely powerful and consistent mitigation so that you can stay just below half health, but not risk getting destroyed by one bad turn where you get hit for 30+ damage. Meat on the bone makes taking this less risky, but does also make it harder to trigger in subsequent fights. At higher ascensions, losing health is less avoidable, and you will more naturally end up below half health, so it gets better there too. Upgrade is fine, does make it easier to follow up and use the strength if you are already under half health.",

      "content": "this is a great card, that I skip. 6 strength for just 1 energy is incredible value, but you need to be below half health to use this. Theres just one issue with that though, champ is very powerful. His block is fantastic and his front loaded damage is even better. If champ is ever below half health its probably in act 1 where you wont likely have this rare card anyways. Given that you heal in between acts its possible that if you take this it will just become a dead card later in the game since you wont go back to being injured again if all is going well. That said last stand is useful to take at the very end of the game if you can see it; as an easy way to add strength to your deck for act 4 since you expect to take some blows there.",
