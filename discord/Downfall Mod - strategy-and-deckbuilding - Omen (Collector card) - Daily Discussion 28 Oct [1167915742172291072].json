      "content": "Current Omen is extremely powerful. The upgrade is a huge part of why, being able to guarantee this on turn 1, and even being able to proc it to gain a strength right away with the collected card from turn 1 gives it so much consistency. If you've ever bottled demon form, it's usually pretty clunky and can severely cost you (chip damage) in hallway fights unless you have multiple good turn 1 relics to go alongside it like anchor, bag of preparation, and lantern. Bottling demon form is sometimes situationally correct to do towards the end of act 2 or midway through act 3, but you can't really control when you see bottled tornado. Omen has none of those issues, because it only costs 1 energy, it can start generating strength the turn you cast it, it can make itself innate without needing to find a bottle, and you already have a mini bag of preparation and lantern on collector with your starting relic and the way that collected cards work. I really strongly believe that the cost should be increased and that the upgrade should be changed for the sake of balancing this card properly.\n\nThe funny thing is that collector has at least 2 other ways to fulfill the role this card does, both of which are quite strong in their own right. A single copy of Dark Lord Form effectively gives you all the damage scaling and weak/vulnerable you would ever need, just requiring that you find some way to block while waiting for the doom to scale up. A single copy of empower with the right setup from either chem X, energy relics, or reserve generation can also easily provide all the damage scaling you would ever need for major boss fights. Strong as omen is, there are plenty of times where I think adding it to your deck would be incorrect if you already had one of these other engines in place, and what your deck really needed was more frontloading or better defensive tools to round it out instead.",

      "content": "Omen is not really necessary for act 1, but can be a useful tool into lagavulin and the act boss. From the start of act 2 onwards, it's incredibly cheap scaling is very useful in medium and long hallway fights, and it can easily carry you through the healing from god of life in act 4. Having a somewhat larger collected deck lets its effect last longer, krampian cole is excellent to let this not only keep triggering forever, but also to let you do so very cheaply, and it also lets you keep a much smaller, more curated collected deck. If you are playing with a larger collected pile to support this, dark apotheosis is very helpful to make each individual collected card better. Forgery and Double trouble can really help accelerate the scaling from omen significantly. Very strong with mummified hand, trick's bolster rod, and bag of tricks.",
