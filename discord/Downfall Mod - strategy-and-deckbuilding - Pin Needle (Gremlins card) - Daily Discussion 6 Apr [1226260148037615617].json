      "content": "Solid damage tool, adding the pinprics lets you have more cheap ways to trigger ninja relics and gremlin on attack effects. Upgrading this makes it fundamentally a different card (sort of like pommel strike) in that it turns it into true card draw, as before the pinpricks would just be getting in the way of what you would have drawn off of them anyways. It's a very powerful upgrade that will help accelerate your gameplan, even if the draw is delayed until you find the copies of pinprick+. For any strategy based on spamming lots of attacks (and gremlins have several available to them) this is a great tool to enable playing all those cards. Can be a little awkward against enemies that punish spamming attacks, like snake plant, writhing mass, spikers, IC 3 with flame barrier, and thorns empowered neow, but I think it's powerful enough everywhere else to be a good pickup overall, especially with the right relic support (pen nib, ink bottle, and dead branch both play very well with this). Active anti-synergy with snecko eye. Notably has lots of good gremlins cross synergies, so you don't need to worry about this getting weaker if you need to pivot later in the run.",

      "content": "this is fine. Pin needle is one of the many very good act 1 attacks and it does well for most of the game as well off sneaky gremlin bonus damage. Especially with its very powerful upgrade. However this card crucially does not scale nearly as well as other sneaky gremlin attacks, pinpricks are a liability vs neow and watcher and pin needle itself exhausts so you aren't even getting a shadow shiv from it. In the end game pin needle's delayed damage makes it worse then other attacks in act 4; which is usually going to be your only concern when playing gremlins. Still this cards high numbers makes it a good pick more often then not but I would advice not adding too many pin needles to one deck.",

      "content": "3 strength for free is still relevant (same goes for wiz) in act 4. Plus you can scale shivs directly with polish, something that does not work on pinpricks. Strength benefits other gremlin attacks far more then this one anyways; like erupt turns a card like show stopper into a nuke. This needs an upgrade to become true card draw and upgrades are pretty high demand on this character.  Fat gremlin is weird since you need burly blow to make stacking weak work for your damage; otherwise your just going to use another gremlin to attack with. Since if you aren't using fat gremlin to scale, you never need to apply weak more then once or twice (since the majority of fights in the game wont be going past like turn 4)",
