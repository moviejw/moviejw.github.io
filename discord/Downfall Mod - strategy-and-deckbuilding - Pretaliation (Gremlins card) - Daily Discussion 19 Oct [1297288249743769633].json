      "content": "Very weird card. It's basically dead any time you draw it when you're not being attacked (quite a few bosses have off turns, many elites do as well). It's also a 2 cost attack, when what gremlins really want are cheap attacks like shivs and 1 costs that let them trigger their passive bonuses as many times as possible. Spending 2 energy on this also doesn't let you benefit from some of the powerful spam-rewarding cards like flurry or bubble barrier. 20 (27) damage for 2 energy is a pretty good deal when it works (right about where carnage is), but 2 cost attacks as a whole just aren't that appealing on gremlins, and there is a significant risk of dead-drawing this. Gremlins also has frontloaded attacks that deal much more consistent damage, and work better within the synergies of the character (shiv generating cards to pair with strength and passives, multihits like cat scratch and dagger dance to pair with wiz). Your deck only needs so many frontloaded damage cards, and it really helps if they can provide some additional utility as well for the later stages of the run. This card will never do anything beyond the damage, doesn't have the exhaust synergies of carnage, and doesn't transition well at all into the lategame. Unless you are desperate for attacks in act 1 and have found nothing better, you should probably skip this most of the time. Upgrade is also quite risky (though the damage increase is huge), doubling down on the risk of dead-drawing it, since the minimum damage isn't increased at all.\n\nCute with necronomicon, pen nib, and snecko eye, I think I would probably be willing to take a copy after grabbing necro. Runic pyramid guarantees lining the timing up, but there are better things you can be doing with pyramid than casting this, and casting it will be difficult while stuck on 3 energy. I just don't really feel like this card makes sense for gremlins at all. It doesn't fit in with any of their themes or synergies.",
