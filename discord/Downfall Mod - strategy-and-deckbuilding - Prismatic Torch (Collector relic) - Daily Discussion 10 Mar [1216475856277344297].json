      "content": "I used this a lot when it was the old version (not once per turn) and it was incredibly strong, definitely deserved the nerf, as it could let you have all the energy you needed fairly easily. Haven't yet had the chance to play witht he new once per turn version, but I am very willing to bet that it's still quite good. First and foremost, reserves are much stronger than regular energy, since you can float them between turns. Even just 2 or 3 reserve often feels like you have ice cream in terms of the freedom it gives you to make big plays on the right turns. This also spots you the first reserve, as well as the first ember right away, which makes it much more reliable than hovering kite as an energy relic. All you need to do is draw a pyre card anywhere in the first 2 turns (during which you draw 12 cards due to the collected pile) and you are doing better than you would with a normal energy relic since it gives reserve (and it also effectively mimics vajra once you burn the first ember). I believe I would take this over many of the very good energy relics like cursed key, coffee dripper, or fusion hammer. I think it is powerful enough to be a factor in deciding not to boss swap (though I already really like collectors starting relic).\n\nYou very likely already have some pyre cards by the time you find this, as there are several strong ones which can provide frontloaded damage. You probably will want to take a few more to support this further, but it usually feels natural to do so. Embers are a little harder to come by, but fleeting embers and sunbloom kindling both provide a lot of support very efficiently, and adding an ashen strike or a heat wave to your deck is also a reasonable way to support it in longer fights. The bigger problem with embers is that you don't usually want/need them as long term scaling solutions or as fuel for pyre, so you do sometimes have to go out of your way and make your deck a bit worse to accommodate prismatic torch.",
