      "content": "2 things come to mind when looking at pyromancy. Just how much better is reserve than energy, and how difficult is it (in terms of chip damage) to devote some of your energy to playing scaling cards on collector that have no effect this turn? I think reserve is at least 1.5 times as good as regular energy, because it's very snowbally. Having even 2 or 3 reserve energy on hand (which fuel the fire from your starter deck gives you straight away) basically gives you most of the effect of ice cream and allows you to do some really silly things where you can play tons of cards/play expensive cards very freely and have huge turns. When you pair this with collected cards naturally drawing you a 6th card every turn, and some incentives to draft expensive cards on collector, it gets out of hand really quickly, and enables you to play anything you want. It also helps that collector has some very powerful X cost cards that can use reserve in insanely strong ways (stash away, empower), as well as big powers like Dark Lord Form, Shooting star, and several collected powers that give you plenty of strong outlets to pay you out for having tons of energy to spend.\n\nAs for the second question, the very existence of reserve and collected cards essentially answers it. The major drawback of scaling cards (often powers) is that they should be awkward in shorter and medium length fights where their effects aren't very good, and where drawing them puts you in a very awkward position where it's effectively a curse in a really tough fight like book of stabbing, snake plant, triple jaw wurm, tri-slavers, or avocado rat (most of act 2, and a good portion of act 1 hallway fights essentially). Since you naturally draw 6 cards a turn, being a \"curse\" in those shorter fights doesn't matter anywhere near as much, and since you start the run with ice cream (fuel the fire+ and emerald torch if you kept it) you can even afford to play them without fearing chip damage very much.",

      "content": "You even have temp hp in your kit, which can specifically adress protecting you from chip damage on hands where you draw too many powers/not enough block cards. There are just so many safety nets to help you safely cast your expensive/slow scaling cards, which gives collector one of the most powerful lategames in downfall. This makes pyromancy into an incredibly strong card, especially when compared with some of it's contemporaries, since the reserves it gives is much stronger than energy, and because your kit makes playing it safely and waiting for the scaling to kick in so much easier. There also aren't a ton of cards that give reserves (though fuel the fire is good enough that there don't need to be), which makes all of them more valuable due to their relative scarcity. Drawing it late in a fight can be a problem, since you really want to get this effect going fast, but not often a run ending one. Having 4 energy rather than 3 makes it both easier to cast and arguably even stronger, since that allows you to stockpile the reserves it gives more easily and have those insane turns down the line. The upgrade is just fantastic, take it ASAP, usually not difficult since you often get this from a rare card reward after beating the act boss, and there is a campfire straight away in the next act. Mummified hand and bird faced-urn make the drawbacks of this card even easier to ignore. Bottling it with a tornado is a great way to set yourself up effectively in longer boss fights and give you a chance to deploy your other scaling cards very cleanly as well. I definitely think reserves on the whole are too powerful, including pyromancy, but that's a really difficult issue to solve.",
