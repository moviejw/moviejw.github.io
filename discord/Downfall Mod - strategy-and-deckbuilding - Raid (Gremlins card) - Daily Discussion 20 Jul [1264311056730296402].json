      "content": "Clearly a very powerful effect, drawing 4 or 5 cards for 1 energy is incredible, and discarding your worst 3 (2) isn't really that big of a deal, and could even be helpful to free up hand space for shivs/wards. Acrobatics+ is one of silents best consistency/combo enabling tools, and raid draws even more cards, without needing an upgrade, and has you discard more. You want to pair raid with very fast combos and burst damage, letting you keep your gremlins alive and end fights quickly, and get any powers/scaling you have set up in a timely fashion. It can also help to find ways to block or switch gremlins around if you need a particular bonus this turn. It's also worth noting that this is more valuable due to scarcity, since gremlins have very few other options for card draw.\n\nNow this card is also very feast or famine. It doubles down heavily on gremlins main weakness, the death spiral. Once things start to go wrong, your cards get worse, more gremlins start to die, it becomes harder to revive the right one later, and usually your run is all but over. The best ways to counter this are to have a very fast deck, buy and hold onto strong potions to cover bad turns, and have as much consistency as possible to cover for bad turns. Raid helps with the last one, provided that the death spiral hasn't already started. I think the effect is definitely strong enough to be worth taking, even though it does amplify your worst case scenario, since it can also do work to prevent it from happening in the first place. You do have to accept that sometimes, you will draw poorly enough though, and one bad turn could just end the run, but that's already pretty inherent to most gremlin playstyles (with slower and more defensive fat/shield focused strategies being the exception) and you would likely have died with or without raid once the spiral starts. Enables flex/shivs, edible armor and block, and other strong combos for gremlins really well.",

Its acutally quite rare that your deck uses just a single gremlin to do everything. As long as you only lose 1 gremlin you can get it back from 1 rest, boss kill or even the potion. A bad turn can kill you in act 4; but thats true for every character.",
