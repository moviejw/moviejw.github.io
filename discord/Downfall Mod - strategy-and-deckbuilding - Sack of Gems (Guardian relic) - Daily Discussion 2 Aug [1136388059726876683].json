      "content": "A very context dependant pick, which is true of a lot of shop relics. The key things to look at are where the next campfire is, how tough the path to that campfire is, how many open sockets you have, and what reasonable cards with sockets are available in the shop. If no campfire is available to you for the rest of the act, picking this up is very questionable, you would have to be either very confident in your deck quality and act boss matchup, or heavily invested into 0 cost synergies with stasis engine and floating orbs. Usually I'm quite happy to buy this if I have even 2-3 open sockets and a campfire reasonably close (anything less than 2 elites in between). If you really need to, you can buy a potion at the same shop to try and carry you through the brief power trough until you can socket your new gems. If there is a well priced (potentially even on sale) copy of prismatic barrier, prismatic spray, or another multi socket card, buying this becomes much more reasonable.\n\nNote that just like with pick of rhapsody, the random gems will be generated similarly to a transform, giving you good odds of getting mostly uncommon and rare gems (30 percent chance for a common, 50 percent chance for an uncommon, 17 percent chance for a rare). If you already have some of the pieces of the really good gem combos (onyx with ruby/emerald, quartz with citrine, aquamarine with emerald) the value of sack of gems goes up. Also keep in mind any gems currently being sold at the shop, if there's an onyx already available, buying the sack cant find you the emerald or ruby to go with it. If you have something like gem cannon, picking up this many gems to increase it's burst damage can also be very potent, though they may get in the way of drawing it temporarily. If there is a reasonable chance of you fighting gremlin nob, tri-sentries, or the chosen before you reach the next campfire, buying this is very risky. Easier to take if you have letter opener or ink bottle to combo.",

      "content": "My personal playstyle with guardian usually involves 30+ card decks, with an emphasis on setting up lots of stasis cards, and looping particularly powerful cards with reroute and recover. Gems and gem combos are one of the better ways to create those really strong cards to loop, and gems in general just help your cards to be more efficient, so I really like picking up as many as I can (within reason) to fill up my socket cards. Sack of gems is a great tool to do this, and has a lot of flexibility with the shop you are in to help accommodate what you end up with (similar to orrery in that way). I'm really happy with most of the gems, with only sapphire standing out as being particularly low impact. Some decks also really don't need the extra vulnerable from garnet, or can't make much use of the crystal shiv from fragmented gem, but most of the time they are quite good. Because of the generally high quality of gems, I really don't mind the random element on a relic like this, as it's very likely to eventually make your deck better (you need to open sockets, and to reach a campfire).",
