      "content": "Usually very handy, since gremlins are susceptible to death spirals if you have a few bad turns (or sometimes even just one). Knowing that you can play this and have a get out of jail free card for one dangerous attack is really nice to avoid losing key gremlins. It is a bit expensive, and upgrading makes it easier to fit into your turns while still being productive (though it's more of a luxury upgrade that you don't always have time for). You can also just cast this on a turn where you are getting attacked for 25+ damage to dodge that attack and put the rest of your energy into damage. Will only block part of a multi-hit that breaks block, though you use the swap to have the rest hit a non-essential gremlin if you lead with an important one.\n\nProbably slightly better than buffer, the swap can have some minor synergy bonuses (though it can also throw off decks trying to lead with one specific gremlin). The big difference is that downfall has a few less enemies that rely on massive multihit attacks that threaten you (the heart being the big one) that threaten it. Beat of death is particularly rough on buffer (removing it instantly/removing 1 stack if you had no block beforehand) and scatter! doesn't have to deal with that. There are a few more off turns against big act bosses as well where you can cast this to get a safety net for a future turn too. Gremlins naturally low health and potential to death spiral also makes scatters protective effect more valuable (defect is far less vulnerable to being one shot than a critical lead fat/sneaky gremlin, and also has better defensive consistency overall with frost/focus, and can patch back up with echo form+self repair).\n\nQuite good even in act 1 to dodge the big hit from nob and the 20 hit attacks from lagavulin. Several act 1 bosses also use big single attacks to threaten you (sunder, immolate, roughhouse). Gremlins early game damage is usually good enough to let you take a utility card like this early and be fine.",
