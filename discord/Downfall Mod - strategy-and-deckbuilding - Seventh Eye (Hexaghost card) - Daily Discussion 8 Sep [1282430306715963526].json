      "content": "Seek is perhaps one of the strongest cards in the entire base game, especially considering it's upgrade. There is plenty of room for a card to be worse than it, but still quite powerful, and that's basically where seventh eye sits. It's also an uncommon of course, and so much easier to find, though not all decks can include it well. It can lead to a lot of unpredictability in trying to move along the wheel, but it gets your absolute best card for the situation out of your deck. That's often going to be a power or other scaling piece, sometimes it will be a critical frontloaded/mitigation/aoe card to answer a dangerous fight. Other times you can simply grab an afterlife card to get more output from a turn. Seventh eye is going to be as powerful as the toolbox you build around it, but the cost of switching to a random ghostflame is going to be well worth it when you can get a critical specter's wail+ to answer an AOE fight, that ghost shield to blur block over into a difficult next turn, that incorporeal to mitigate 40+ damage for the turn, or making sure you find your infernal form on turn 1 of a boss fight. Much easier to play in decks that aren't very focused on using the wheel, or that can retract/advance to position themselves more favorably. Costing 1 energy also hurts it, but if you are grabbing afterlife cards, you're often able to recoup some of the cost anyways, and you can also use it to grab opposing action+ to generate energy on a key turn if you need to. Upgrading seventh eye, or finding it pre-upgraded greatly increases it's power and utility, and even though it's single use, I would consider it a high priority upgrade, especially for decks that might want to tutor out unlimited power.",

If you have the right toolbox, I think taking and upgrading one of these is a great way to smooth out variance with your deck. If it's absolutely critical that you move around the wheel clockwise and quickly, then you should likely avoid it, but in a lot of short and medium length fights, it won't be as important that you move towards the inferno ghostflames, and so the cost of moving to a random one isn't that steep. You usually don't want to take a card like this before your deck has a few really juicy targets to tutor for, so I usually wouldn't take it until act 2 when I hopefully have some key, often upgraded, cards to find.",

You can still prepare yourself somewhat by checking your hand first, and trying to pick a card that covers as many options as possible. If you have no powers in hand, you might speculatively take one to cover the possiblity of landing on the bolsetering ghostflame. If you have something like nightmare guise or nightmare strike in your deck, picking those ensures you can light the crushing/searing flames respectively. Usually though, most of the time, you just want to get as much raw power/scaling as you can, or to tutor out a specific answer to a difficult turn, regardless of where you might end up (specters' wail+, incorporeal, inferno form).",
