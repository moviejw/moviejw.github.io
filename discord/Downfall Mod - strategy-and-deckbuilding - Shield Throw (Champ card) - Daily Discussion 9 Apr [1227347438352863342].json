For a card like enraged bash to be good; you need a fairly small deck and to be able to keep drawing into it; it requires about 4 plays to become truly strong (which is 24 damage + 4 procs of vigor). Shield throw does not take any significant set up to be good; you just need block cards. For example, you can play bring it on to gain 18 block; which lets shield throw do 36 damage. Thats just 2 energy and only 2 cards in my hand without considering scaling and its already strong. Shield throw can often outperform decks built around maximizing a certain attack's effectiveness, even when its awkwardly jammed into them. To say nothing about the horrors you can inflict on the spire if you manage to find 2 shield throws and build around them as your focus..",

      "content": "This is a truly ridiculous card. It's body slam, but it hits twice, on a character that is very good at stacking vigor. It technically sometimes has a drawback, but avoiding it is laughably easy, and it usually doesn't even matter because this ends the fight most of the time. Body slam is already a very potent card, and sure this a rare instead of a common, but hitting twice is extremely OP. I'm not sure where you would start to nerf this (maybe increase the cost) but it really deserves a nerf. Even if you take this from the heart bonus, you can play 1 or 2 defends and it still hits for at least 10/20 damage (more with skill bonuses giving vigor) for 1(0) energy, and that's the card at it's absolute worst.\n\nGets even better with runic pyramid, calipers, boat relics, iron fortress, oddly smooth stone, good clean fight, backstep, hold firm, and pen nib. Upgrade is really strong, very worth taking since it lets you play more block cards and stack more vigor before using this. It's a pretty classic champ card, in that it can provide enough frontloaded damage to delete fights well into act 3, but even better since it also allows you to build an effective defensive plan as part of the strategy to handle lategame. You will still of course need to find something to help you deal sustained, scaling damage in late game, but you have plenty of time to find something before reaching act 4.",
