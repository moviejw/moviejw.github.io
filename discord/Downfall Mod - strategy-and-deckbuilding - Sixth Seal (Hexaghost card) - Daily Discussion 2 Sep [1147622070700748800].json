      "content": "Very powerful rare that offers tons of meta scaling potential. Most of the seals are fantastic (second seal being the weakest link IMO, but still good) and being able to essentially guarantee that you can successfully work towards creating a broken seal allows you to convert your efforts into a very strong relic that gives you permanent front-loaded stats, as well as a full heal on creation. Even beyond forming broken seal, being able to pick up extra copies of 5th seal (upgrades), a backup 4th seal (potion), and more copies of 3rd seal (extra card reward) can be extremely powerful to help scale your deck in other ways. The seals are a bit strange, in that not only is obtaining the broken seal a big payoff (while also removing the seals from your deck and thinning it nicely), but that the majority of them are just very useful cards to have even if you don't manage to build exodia. I feel like there should be more risk involved in stockpiling them, as the reward for getting them all is so powerful, but right now I don't think you get punished very hard for being greedy in your pursuit of broken seal (afterlife also contributes to this problem, giving you so much free output and block that you these sorts of slow meta scaling cards are too easy to include safely).\n\n Very happy to see this rare from a boss reward (and 3rd seal even gives you extra shots at it), would usually buy it at a shop assuming I could carry it for the next few floors with good potions or afterlife cards. It should be too greedy to take this from your heart bonus at the start of the run, but you can likely get away with it if you path away from elites, or go after afterlife/front-loaded cards more than normal to compensate (terrible into all 3 act 1 elites, and quite bad in most hallway fights, but having it that early can make the late game a breeze if you can survive the early game). Once you have 4 energy, sixth seal is much easier to play safely, especially with sword/shield of night.",

      "content": "Insane with snecko eye (as are many of hexaghosts cards, especially afterlife), bird faced urn, and mummified hand. Upgrade is something you don't really need (same for most seals), but could make sense if you have runic pyramid, and is okay if it comes pre upgraded from frozen egg. The strength it gives you can be very powerful with several different multi-hit cards, but is less valuable if you are heavily skewed towards soulburn as your primary damage. The dexterity is great with your free afterlife block cards and basic defends. Having the extra intensity makes all ghostflame related effects stronger, and makes you want to invest more in cards that let you get multiple ignitions at once. Even the Max HP is pretty handy to cover your somewhat low starting health, especially on higher ascensions. \n\nI feel like seals as a whole likely do deserve a nerf, I love the goal they provide, but it's a little too consistent, and generally too safe to go after considering how strong most of the seal cards are even if you never manage to never assemble broken seal. Sixth seal itself looks like it should be balanced by the high cost and low immediate impact, but I rarely feel like I get punished for including and casting it. I think that afterlife is the far bigger problem for Hexaghosts overall balance, and that ghost shield and hexaguard in particular stand out as ridiculously powerful cards that allow the seals to feel much easier to include safely than they ought to be.",
