      "content": "Thanks for leaving a thorough response; much appreciated to have my proposal taken seriously.\n\nI think I need to clarify on a few of the categories you had complaints about.\n> damaging skill\nA lot of characters have damaging skills in their main mechanics. Silent has Poison/Shivs, Defect has Lightning/Dark orbs, Watcher has a couple Wrath entries, but also Pressure Points and Wreath of Flame, Hexa has Soulburn, Slime Boss has Goop, Champ has Stances (which, similar to Wrath, would actually count thanks to a couple proposed changes I made to how these categories find cards), and Hermit has a bit of Bruise. The ones that get left out of Main Mechanic damaging skills are Ironclad, Automaton, and Gremlins, but there still exist some others to compensate. Ironclad has Flame Barrier, Gremlins have Change-O, Gremlin Arms, and Irritability. (Auto truly has nothing.) Between all these, there seemed to be enough, so long as you know what to count (anything that does damage directly, or by a token card, or in a keyword.)\n> tackle\nThis is part of the same UNID card that Strike is, not its own card. Similarly, Twice/Double/Triple is all one UNID card.\n> 0 cost attack\nWhen I played Snecko, I felt that the existing UNID 0-cost was too weak to take on a character that could discount the cost of stronger cards. However, in discussions with other people on the server, I discovered that some of them actually liked it a lot and took it with decent frequency. I feel that moving it to common and narrowing it to attacks made it much more consistent in what effect you were going to get from that most of the time, and doing so allowed more room to build around limited energy, especially in the early game, when you needed it to be accessible. As far as variety goes, most characters have at least 2 of these, and a decent number have 3 or 4.\n> self debuff\nI thought this would be good general value if you can play around the downside, with compensation in identifying it, but I could understand if it doesn't work out.\n> cost reduction\nI'm not sure why you wouldn't want this one. It can either be cards of good value that can discount themselves (great with snecko) or cards that can discount other cards (also great with snecko). If you could elaborate, that would be great.\n> most characters only have a single attack that gives block and does damage\nThe category in question here is \"damaging block\", which is not just limited to attacks, but can include things like Flame Barrier. That being said, I did look through that category's card pool again, and there wasn't as much there as I thought there were. I can understand this one not working out as well (and maybe it's for the best; it's kind of a boring card design lol).\n> metascaling\nYou may be surprised to learn there are a total of 17 Metascaling cards: Feed, Alchemize, Genetic Algorithm, Lesson Learned, Wish, 2nd-5th Seals (healing could technically count as metascaling, but then it would bleed heavily into the UNID HP card, so I'm not counting it on the technicality that it doesn't actually scale you), Cultist Strike, Mass Feed, Gem Finder, Cursed Weapon, Golden Bullet, Scavenge, and Dead or Alive (18 if you count Hand of Greed, but that's colorless and can't be accessed right now). Every character has at least 1, except for Champ. I don't think this card pool being small is an issue, really. It's a powerful and fun effect, and being a small card pool doesn't necessarily mean abusable if most of the cards are strong. If you're going to identify a card that has a strong effect most of the time, it's because you're looking for something that fits your specific deck, rather than trying to single out the one broken card from the bunch, like Wraith Form from UNID Dex currently.",

      "content": "> this all sorta just breaks pure snecko mode\nThis was not created with Pure Snecko in mind - I was under the impression that Pure Snecko was intended to be a self-imposed challenge for maximum chaos. I did end up prioritizing playing Pure Snecko when I was still playing them, because picking 3 classes was just a question of which classes had the best average value, and I didn't like that, so I went Pure Snecko for less abusable situations. So I can understand if Pure Snecko has become the main mode for you too, even if your reasons are different from mine. It's valid to still want Pure Snecko to be a good mode, so I wouldn't want to just ignore if this idea broke that. That said, I am not a dev; it'd be up to them to figure out how they want to handle that aspect, but I'm still open to learning why you think this would happen and if there's any way we could come up with solutions.\n> lastly I disagree that sneckos cards should all be focused on supporting your offclass options. by making them all geared towards offclass you end up hurting sneckos early game even more.\nI used Defect's card pool as an analogy in the document, as it works well to achieve this. It's not pure utility; it has damage and block and other useful frontloaded effects attached to the utility, e.g. Beam Cell, GFTE, and Equilibrium. Snecko does already have a number of cards that are pure utility, such as Soul Roll, Shift, Soul Cleanse, Nope, etc. which I do think actually make the card pool worse already, for the exact reason you were worried. I would like to see those cards changed to have more raw value and would want to avoid reworking the rest of the card pool to be like those cards. Snake Rake I think is a pretty decent example of a good utility card, as it also has some damage attached to it you can lean on.",

Having these experiences are fine in moderation, but as they are dominant right now, they make Snecko start to feel boring to play if you want play them frequently.\n\nI personally think that the fact that your deck is randomized at the start of each combat would still keep the chaotic nature of the character in place. No other character that I know of has this level of chaos, regardless of if we tighten the categories to be more reliable.",

That said I don't have great ideas for replacement that would fix that problem.",

For self debuff I don't see it being reliable when its coming off every character. Theres far to many cards it can turn into that all do something different; picking it wouldn't have much purpose as your unlikely to get one of the cards you acutally want. same thing goes 0 cost attack your just going to get some junk like just lucky, slice or chain clash with just a chance of getting a good card like flash of steal and if you do get a good card its not going to be high impact enough to ID. For the record I think unid 0 cost is terrible right now. If cost reduction gives corruption its alright; but otherwise its more simple to just muddle your cards to reduce the cost (cost reduction just clashes with muddle in general); maybe the card would work if snecko's gameplan changed but I cannot imagine it being good on a snecko thats similar to the one that exists now.",
