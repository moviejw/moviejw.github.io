      "content": "I've had very good experiences with this card, but I do also put a high priority on picking up planning, reroute, and recover. I think the key is having a deck that can very quickly fill up it's stasis slots, ideally with cards that aren't too expensive, and using speed boost as a way to get those cards back into your hand at 0 energy. This gives you pseudo card draw and pseudo energy gain, and also frees your stasis slots back up to fill them again with more cards that will become card draw/energy gain in the future. Speed boost doesn't necessarily say \"draw 3 cards, gain 3 energy\" on it, but with the right support it can feel pretty close to that. The upgrade is also really useful as a way to set yourself up for explosive turns when you really need them (defending against big hits from bosses, playing a massive body crash after a turn in defensive mode, setting up several debuffs and clearing them in one turn).\n\nThe other thing I really like about this card is that it covers for one of guardians biggest weaknesses, taking too long to set up and not frontloading fast enough (orb support is another good tool to cover for this, and plays well with speed boost). Playing speed boost with the appropriate setup can let you get off to a fast start in fights and get the output you need to survive early turns, giving you time to safely get your scaling engines online. This is especially relevant at higher ascensions where enemies threaten you with significant damage much faster. \n\nNow granted, there are two things that make this card somewhat awkward. The first is that guardian just has such a high quality of rares generally, and some of those rares either provide more utility, strong mitigation, better engines/scaling tools, or can tuck into your other cards to condense value (citrine, onyx). Amongst that pool of rares, speed boost is still very good, but doesn't stand out, and other rares can provide more essential tools for clearing a run.",

      "content": "The other thing is that incinerate+ at common comes pretty close to doing the same thing, and is much more accessible, not requiring you to draft it over other rares, or to pay a large quantity of souls at a shop to get it. Between the frontloaded damage and the socket, it could even be considered better than speed boost, especially in the early game when you particularly value that damage. You also have time bomb at uncommon, which can accelerate all your cards in stasis once while dealing significant AOE damage (though it does exhaust) that competes within a similar space. I still think that the third accelerate from speed boost and the retain upgrade are powerful enough to make it an appealing card, letting it outperform the other two in terms of setup potential and spamming stasis cards as fast as possible. Incinerate is much worse without the upgrade, and there are many good upgrades on guardian competing with each other. Because speed boost allows you to spam so many cheap cards, it plays very well with ninja relics, ink bottle, pen nib, nunchaku, and letter opener.",

Incinerate has such a graceful transition from being alright in the early game to being an absolute powerhouse in the late game, between having damage, 2 accelerate, a gem. This on the other hand trade literally all the other utility for 1 more accelerate. I think the upgrade is basically not worth mentioning, the only upgrade for guardian I'd consider worse is stasis engine, and that makes the card actively worse imo.",

      "content": "I think it's a fundamental difference in the evaluation of specific groups of cards here. Stasis engine can trigger on the same turn you play it (it's very difficult, but possible, especially with gems like fragmented and aquamarine). If you have cheap ways to fill your stasis slots (planning, orb support) and ways to quickly bring cards back out (speed boost, incinerate) then it can do a lot of work to accelerate your game plan and ensure that you have your scaling engine online during boss fights, and making it innate can be excellent in that situation. If you're already low on speed boost, then it makes sense that you're also low on stasis engine, and I know many people don't value orb support, and find planning to be too random for their liking. I don't understand how anyone could say that the effect of stasis engine is bad, drawing an extra card and getting an extra energy every turn is incredibly strong (many rare powers just draw you one extra card per turn and are still strong). I can see what you mean by saying that you don't necessarily need the extra draw/energy if you already have a good stasis setup (which provides more or less the same thing), but the additional resources are still powerful, and can help to maintain the stasis setup and give you more energy to play scaling alongside your frontloading.\n\nAlso worth noting that barring frozen egg, you will never have to see pre-upgraded stasis engine (rares are never pre-upgraded). It's only going to be upgraded if you decide to do that at a campfire, and you could wait until late act 3 or act 4 to do that if you are worried about having bad early turns against faster enemies. It's not like infinite blades or battle hymn where you might take an unupgraded copy, but you see a pre-upgraded copy and have to skip it.",

There are plenty of good 0 cost cards for guardian, including 2 gems that can be socketed into other 0 cost cards like suspend and planning. You might not always trigger it the turn you play it, but with the right support, it's very possible to get it online the turn after that.\n\nAs for speed boosts upgrade, sure the retain isn't always relevant, but when it is, it could save you 30+ health, it could allow you to get your scaling online, it could get that critical AOE card out before a massive attack. The goal of Slay the Spire is to increase your equity to win the run, and sometimes that means picking a card or choosing an upgrade not because it's obviously powerful, but because it increases your consistency, and covers for possible bad turns or shuffles of the deck where things go horribly wrong. You don't take it to win harder, you take it to ensure that you are less likely to get screwed by RNG.",
