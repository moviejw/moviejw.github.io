      "content": "This is a very notable card for collector, as one of their very few sources of AOE damage (and relevantly their highest damage one, which can can hit major break points). It's also one of the only ways collector has to manipulate the position of their cards to draw the right tools at the right time. It is expensive as a tradeoff for those benefits, but collector can often manage with their great access to reserves. It's got similar number to doom and gloom for defect, who also has very few AOE options (10, upgrade 14). The AOE is more valuable at the start of the run, and the card manipulation gets better in the later stages when you have more/better tools to put back on top, giving it a good transition between stages of the game.\n\nThe other options for AOE damage are heat wave (very little damage, 0 cost and gives an ember), thorn whip (rare, very good rate, but less total AOE damage which can matter against reptomancer and gremlin leader), and finger of death (not really effective AOE, since it both needs an upgrade, and you likely can't cast it until late in the fight). Whirling flame may not have the best rate, but it gives you the most of the tool you need to solve several key fights during your run, and being energy inefficient is slightly less of a problem for collector than it is for other characters. The upside of being able to put a card back on top to set you up for next turn or potentially draw into this turn is also very helpful to solve other problems that can arise in difficult fights, making whirling flame a very versatile at answering tough fights.",

      "content": "Much easier to use once you have the 4th energy, especially if you want to try to draw the card put on top in the same turn. Great with snecko eye as a 2 cost card, and it can specifically put back other expensive, high impact cards for future snecko rerolls. Upgrade is very good at a +4 that hits all enemies, frequently effectively being a +8 or better when you need it to be. Necronomicon makes this deal massive damage and sets you up even better for next turn, when you can help yourself draw another 2-cost attack as well. I'm usually very happy to take this card, since so many of the toughest fights in the spire (especially elites) demand AOE damage to solve.",
