      "content": "Great to make sure you can both enter stances and get finisher bonuses, especially with dancing master, gladiator's manual or technical jig benefitting from the added consistency. You do need to make sure you have enough finishers in your deck to use this effectively (Usually 4 or more) since it can't fetch one out if you don't have any left in the deck. This can pretty easily give you 8 block/1 strength for 0 energy, as well as fetching up specific finishers based on what the turn needs. The upgrade is pretty important if you want to use this alongside rope a dope or moment of truth as a way to dig through your deck very fast and play tons of finishers during a fight. I think you want to prioritize this upgrade fairly highly, as the ability to reuse this makes your ability to play longer fights quite a bit better, which is often important on champ (most of the short and medium fights are very easy by default, so the long fights are sometimes the only ones that matter in terms of building a toolbox). \n\nThere aren't many other cards that can grab finishers like this, and champ has only limited access to deck manipulation as a whole, so wind up is pretty valuable as a way to counteract that. You do have a lot of stance entry cards, and many of them are also cheap, and naturally reusable. Even as a skill, this can often deal quite a bit of damage alongside berserker stance and fetching finishers, so you can take it quite early in the run to work with your burst-heavy playstyle. It will transition fairly well into the later stages of the game as a way to do more card-draw and long term scaling as long as you find the right finisher to pair with it too.",
