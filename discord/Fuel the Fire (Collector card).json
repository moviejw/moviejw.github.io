      "content": "This is an excellent starter card that really lets collector take expensive cards more easily at the start of the run, and eases them into their synergies with kindlings and embers as well as expensive cards. The pyre is quite useful early in the run to get rid of strikes/defends as well, making your deck better for the second cycle. This plays particularly well into lagavulin, giving you extra energy once it wakes up, and getting rid of a weak card. Decent against nob if you draw it turn 1, but pretty bad otherwise, and really not what you want against tri-sentries, where thinning out your deck is bad against the dazes, and you also won't have a good use for all the energy once you are drawing 3+ dazes a turn. Fairly solid into most of the hallway fights to have big turns later on, and quite nice into ironclad 1 to remove the statuses in your draw pile, and against defect 1 to help counter the energy loss of the voids.\n\nI think what makes this feel so much better than outmaneuver is that your starting relic, emerald torch spots you a reserve at the start of the fight, so you don't have to lose any tempo playing this the first time. It also helps that you don't have to go out of your way to draft it (silent starts so defense/skill heavy that you can't really afford to take outmaneuver for a long time, as you just need frontloaded damage so badly in act 1). Having the energy hold between turns, sort of letting you start the run with your own ice cream, and the utility of the deck thinning is also very helpful.\n\nThe upgrade is not usually something you can take during act 1, collector does need to focus on patching up their frontloaded damage, and upgrading your damage commons/uncommons makes more sense to pair with the vulnerable of You Are Mine! It is a useful upgrade to increase card flow, and it can be nice to take later, but you will usually go for YAM at the starting campfire instead. Pairs well with runic to pyre specific cards and play this on safe turns.",
