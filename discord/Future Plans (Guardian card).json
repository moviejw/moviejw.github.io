In the case of future plans, the innate upgrade is fantastic to get as many cards cost lowered as quickly as possible. You even have guardian gear as an excellent boss relic to help cover your turn 1's.",

      "content": "So Future plans is pretty excellent, I would very rarely skip this card, it's even pretty good into lagavulin and sentries early in the run. It can fill up your stasis slots fairly quickly, which will help with energy issues throughout the run. I would recommend trying to pick up either some accelerate (incinerate, amber, emergency, speed boost) or additional stasis slots (stasis strike, time capacitor, cryo chamber ) so that you can have more free space to use it. Having a good idea of enemy attack patterns is also really helpful, so that you can line up specific cards for specific turns (this is much harder to do than it is with well laid plans, as you may have to plan 2-3 turns ahead). It can be a tad slow to get going, so having some extra brace cards or just generally strong block cards/relics can help give it time to scale you up safely. Can be very good with the debuff package as well, letting you line up your resilient plate/onyx with an emerald/ruby. The upgrade is really solid, but you do want to make sure you have something that can let you afford to play this safely on turn 1, like bag of preparation, lantern, anchor, or guardian gear. I honestly can't even think of a situation where I wouldn't take my first copy, maybe if already have planning and suspension, and have absolutely no accelerate or extra stasis slots.",

Well laid plans makes lining up key combo pieces easy, you just leave them in your hand until you draw the other part (catalyst/burst, reflex/tactician/discard outlets). Because future plans puts cards into stasis, you lose access to them for potentially multiple turns. You can't just hold your neutralize or leg sweep to counter a big attack, you need to specifically understand on what turn that big attack will happen and factor in the cost of the card to determine how long it will take to come back to your hand.",

Well laid plans is significantly easier to play with, since you can just keep holding the same 1 or 2 cards until the right moment to use them comes up.",

      "content": "As for innate power upgrades, I will concede that they can be awkward when they are forced on you, but that is a pretty rare situation, and you can still remove them to counteract it. There's frozen egg (and you can still just skip the power in that case), astrolabe, tiny house, designer in-spire, and shining light (act 1 only). You can also seek out stores to try and find the various relics that help give you the extra safety on turn 1 to play the innate powers safely. There are definitely some innate power upgrades that are much worse than others, like battle hymn, storm, or hello world. However, there are also ones that I think make for interesting situational decision making, which is one my favorite parts of slay the spire runs. Stuff like machine learning, brutality, future plans, and infinite blades (can be very good with ninja relics, mummified hand, and card spam payoffs, not to mention ring of the snake helping to mitigate the downside in fights where you need a faster turn 1)",
