      "content": "This is a very difficult card to evaluate. To begin with there are 65 different collectible cards shown in the compendium (That doesn't seem to include the boss specific ones like adapt or corpse explosion, I have not seen them generated by this either). I'm not 100 percent sure how this card handles generating certain event specific collected cards, which make up 20 of those. Also not sure how it handles soulless husk, but I have definitely used it to make Ouroboros. That still leaves at least 44 possible results to pull from (standard hallway and elite enemies), of which you get to see 3 and pick 1. That leaves a tremendous amount of room for variance, and leaves you vulnerable to not finding a useful/good card when you cast this. It makes up for some of that with its flexibility, allowing you to change your strategy depending on what the fight is asking of you, and being capable of fulfilling many different roles, but you are still at the mercy of RNG in terms of what you get to pick from.\n\nAs for the overall quality of collected cards, some are much better than others, and are usually very overdrafted during normal runs. Greenpyre Locus doesn't distinguish here, and so it's quite possible to see 3 fairly weak options, or to high roll and generate one of the better ones. It's fun to adapt your plans to what you see, and to get to play with cards that normally aren't good enough to put in your collected deck, but the quality difference between the best and worst collected cards, and the very large pool this is drawing from mean that it will have very inconsistent results. I have really enjoyed playing with the card, but I would have a difficult time seriously recommending drafting it without synergies.\n\nNow as for the effect itself, the wording can be a bit deceptive. In addition to adding the 2 (3) copies to your collected pile, it also adds 1 copy to your hand, so this is not card disadvantage.",

      "content": "It can absolutely dilute the quality of your likely very curated collected pile, and there is notably no option to skip if you see 3 duds. What it does do for you is essentially put a \"collected card\" in your main deck, allowing you to play an additional one on the turn you draw greenpyre locus, speeding up your omen/shadow daggers/feel my pain. You can also use it alongside double trouble to have an additional option to multiply, which gives it some extra flexibility. It's sort of strange with dark apotheosis, none of the cards get upgraded if you play this after it. However, if you play this before dark apotheosis, the copies added to your collected pile will be upgraded, but not the copy put into your hand. I do like this card quite a bit in decks aiming to spam collected cards to speed up omen and play a large shadow daggers, and I think it adds some nice flexibility to double trouble, especially since it can generate high cost collected cards that are better to double, but that you wouldn't necessarily take normally.\n\nIt does have some issues with being a low impact skill that essentially requires playing 2 cards (itself, and the card added to your hand), and gremlin nob is already a bit of an issue for collector, so I don't recommend taking this in act 1. Also fairly awkward into chosen and watcher 3. The upgrade is quite bad, diluting your collected deck further if you get a bad result, and just making it more difficult generally to access the curated selection of cards you intentionally drafted into your collected deck. It could make some sense to take if you were running a very small collected deck and were worried about running out of cards (and didn't have krampian coal), but even then it's pretty marginal. This is one of the worst upgrades in downfall right now, actively bad to take most of the time. Upgrading the collectible would be much better. Solid with orange pellets to add extra powers/attacks, triggers ink bottle and letter opener cheaply.",
