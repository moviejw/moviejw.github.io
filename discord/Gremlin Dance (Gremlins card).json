      "content": "Pretty nice starter card, has some elements of utility, and encourages looking to swap around to get the best possible effect. Does encourage playing with fat/sneaky as the lead, since their effects are much more powerful than the others in most situations (I believe that arms theft is the only other source of strength down for gremlins). Those also happen to be the only two gremlins who get to proc their own passives (apply weak, 3 damage to a random target) when you cast this card. Shield is probably the next best effect, there are definitely moments where gremlins need the bonus block in an emergency. You might go for the wiz if it's your only way to setup a big multihit/aoe card for the turn, but there are much easier ways to get wiz as gremlins. Mad loses out here, while the AOE is nice to have as an option, you have several very good AOE cards like dagger dance (and shivs can be used to take out smaller enemies too) that will usually make more sense to use.\n\nThe flexibility of being able to choose your effect, especially when combined with tag team, makes for some interesting gameplay decicions. Gremlin dance immediately starts the discussion about whether you should try to focus on having one gremlin as your party leader (to build around and maximize their effects) or whether you should look to swap around for better utility and more flexible playmaking. Given that your starter relic is half a bag of prep+lantern, but forces you to swap gremlins at the start of each fight, I often find that it's worth trying to build with at least some swapping as part of your plan, though I do try to put a premium on the commons that let you swap back to a specific leader.\n\nGremlin dance works pretty well in act 1, the option of making it aoe covers some of the harder hallway fights and tri sentries. The strength down and block are useful against the nob matchup, and you can use it to build wiz before starting lagavulin.",

      "content": "What it doesn't do is a ton of damage, so you are going to want to look to add 3 or more strike+ type cards to give your deck more frontloaded damage for the early game. It's usually going to be a better upgrade than tag team, because sometimes the +3 gets to be AOE, and to just increase your frontloading generally. However, there is merit to upgrading tag team first if you really being able to hold onto it as insurance against bad turns (and I often try to upgrade it later in the run if I can, so getting it done early has it's advantages as well). It really depends on how confident you are about your ability to have a strong act 1 based on the available pathing and your heart bonus. I would basically never prioritize upgrading gremlin dance if I upgraded tag team (or a card given by the heart) at the start of the run instead. Runic pyramid is really handy with this to be able to hold onto it until the right moment to use a crucial mode, especially the strength down of fat gremlin. Overall, I think it's in quite a good place balance wise, but I do think it does make you bias slightly away from mad/wizard, and slightly towards fat/sneaky at the start of the run.",
