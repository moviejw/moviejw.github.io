It feels rather medicare, although collector can afford this you also need to draw another expensive card along side jaded jabs and be willing to discard it. If you destroy a 3 cost card you get 4 shivs equaling 29 damage. Thats below average for a 3 cost attack and the only real benefit you get is having 4 procs for feel my pain. Besides those expense cards are good, you don't want to be exhausting them.",

      "content": "I will say that I liked this better at 2 energy, so that you could more easily cast other scaling/defensive cards in the same turn. However, it's still a very solid synergy payout to amplify strength, proc calls more often, and work with you ninja relics/ink bottle. It procs the heck out of dead branch as well (granted it's a free win already on the character). It also an effective frontloaded attack that lets you clear the act 1 elites and hallways when you need to spend lots of energy on damage, which is valuable to have. If you assume you're exhausting mostly 1 and 2 cost cards, it deals 23-27 damage, which is under rate for a 3 cost card, but the synergies it has make up for it in my opinion. Later in a run, you can use the pyre on embers, strikes, defends, statuses, and curses when you don't need the damage as much, and would prefer to thin your deck for scaling instead. Any card that helps clear act 1 and has the ability to still provide relevant utility later in the run has solid potential in my book.\n\nIt does have some fairly stiff competition when you look at collectors other frontloaded attacks. Forgery provides an excellent utility element/card draw. Roast also has pyre, and as a 0 cost plays very well with naturally drawing 6 cards a turn. Hurting and I'll take that at uncommon have higher damage per energy, and other useful riders. Inflict agony is a great tool for applying affliction, and whirling flame provides both AOE and card manipulation. I think where jaded jabs stands out is it's ability to synergize with relics and amplify strength, and I don't generally think you should be taking it highly without already having some relevant synergies for it. It can be a very good pickup later in a run if you find kunai or ink bottle, as being able to proc them so many times for 1 card drawn can be really useful. Even if you just end up with omen or empower as your late game scaling, having a card that uses strength 3-4 times is massive to finish fights.",

Snecko eye is fantastic with it, allowing you to exhaust 3 cost strikes/defends/low impact cards, and making the jabs itself cheaper to cast fairly often. You can also pair it with necronomicon to deal massive damage, thin your deck down, and proc relics/pen nib several times. It has some nice self synergy with embers, since it lets you both gain the strength from them as a pyre card, and it pays that out as a way to hit multiple times. Upgrade is effectively +4 damage and +1 card played, which is definitely below rate for a 3 cost card, but does make it's ninja relic synergies better.",
