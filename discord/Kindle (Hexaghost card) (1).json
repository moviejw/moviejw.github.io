It's also one of two ways in Hexaghost's entire draft to renewably ignite the Bolstering Ghostflame while on it, the other being <Flare Flick>. I just want to point out that 9 Block and 1 Strength for 1 Energy is a lot in the early game. That's a good portion of Block that isn't lowered by Lagavulin's debuffs.\nAlso, you really can't ignore that it's one of the four sources of Double Ignition in the entire draft. The others being the aforementioned Flare Flick, but there's also <Haunting Echo>, <Catch Up>, and <Instant Inferno>. Catch Up also requires a bit more movement to properly use. Haunting Echo is a great card, but unlike Kindle, it can't ignite the Bolstering Ghostflame just by itself. Flare Flick is a strong card for sure, but it also costs 2 and Hexa thrives on 1 and 0 cost cards to make the most of out each draw to convert them into Ghostflame tokens. Instant Inferno also exhausts, so it isn't a permanent scaling solution.\nThe best way to use this card is to have a lot of draw so you can use it to either save 1 energy on a Ghostflame, ignite the Bolstering Ghostflame, or to Double Ignite the Inferno Ghostflame. Of course, there's also Runic Pyramid, without a doubt the best boss relic for Hexa, which near 100% guarentees scaling off of the Inferno and consistency for the Bolstering Ghostflame, as well as all other Ghostflames forever.\nThe upgrade on this card isn't great until you have powers <Empowered Flame> or relics <Mark of the Ether> <Teakwood Match> that benefit from it, or you have enough intensity that using this card to reignite Kindle after having played a power that turn blocks for a substantial amount.",

It's usually how you beat your Act 1 hero, especially considering that it boosts Soulburn application from your Searing Ghostflames, which will ignore whatever the act 1 hero is blocking for, which is especially important for Watcher 1, Hermit 1, and Ironclad 1.\nIf I'm trying to scale off of the Inferno, I'm going to put heavy value on Advance, any and all draw, 0 Costs, any method of Retain for consistency (especially Runic Pyramid), Cheap forms of Block so I can keep going around the Wheel as fast as possible, like Afterlife cards to benefit from my draw. I also want Energy to continue the combo as much as possible, usually <Time Warp>. Kindle ends up being pivotal in these fast, Inferno scaling decks because it is renewable and is already inside of the deck, meaning I don't have to add many cards to the deck, including power cards.\nNow, every 4 points of Intensity is another 48 damage off of your Double Ignited Inferno. This is a lot, but not enough to win on its own in Act 3 and 4 if you're doing it every 6 turns. Don't do it every 6 turns. Try to do it every 3 turns.",

Double Igniting the other Ghostflames is nice, but should be considered a bonus rather than a requirement for your scaling and damage. Against Neow and the Corrupt Heart, you basically want to be speedrunning the Wheel so you have to deal with Regen 50 and the Heart's Strength Up as little as possible.\nOutside of Inferno Scaling, if you're using Infernal Form (or Ethereal), it's not a requirement but is still very helpful frontloaded damage. Just don't try to force it like on an Inferno Scaling deck.",

      "content": "One other point to add to blue's posts is that kindle in the starting deck is also very helpful to get soulburn going on turn 1, and let you keep going and have momentum to move around the wheel. It helps fill in the gaps on turns where you can't quite ignite the current ghost flame, letting you get it for 1 energy instead, and allowing you to get some value, and continue progressing towards the other parts of the wheel, which contain very nice rewards like bolstering and inferno. If you draw no attacks turn 1, but you do have kindle, you can just cast it and that ensures that you get soulburn going for the earliest possible detonation (start of enemies turn 3, before they get to act). Admittedly, yes that soulburn goes on a random target, which could cause real issues in multi-enemy fights, but that's always true of searing ghostflames regardless of how you ignite them (barring the potion that makes them apply to all enemies). Having that little insurance policy against bad draws preventing wheel progression is really nice in the starting deck.\n\nThe more major role of the card is for double ignition, which can be underwhelming at first, but tends to get much more valuable as you start picking up sources of intensity/advance. You want to be able to have enough ability to move around the wheel to double ignite the most rewarding ghostflames. Even a small amount of intensity makes the flames start dealing a much more respectable amount of damage. Double igniting the inferno ghostflame closes out most fights pretty definitively, or gives you enough intensity to help you clean them up in short order. However, it's usually difficult to make act 1 fights last long enough/advance often enough to get that benefit. It tends to become more relevant as you start fighting enemies with more health later in the run, usually in act 3, but also against most (all?) bosses.",

      "content": "The upgrade is usually not super necessary in my opinion until later in the run, when you are better at reaching a fully prepared inferno ghostflame, and when you have plenty of powers to have a better shot at double igniting the bolstering. Having intensity access also makes double ignition much rewarding, so that is another reason to look into upgrading this, and it can even sometimes be used to ignite a flame 3 times in one turn once upgraded if you also have other cards like flare flick or haunting echo. The extra damage from sear is just too important for act 1, and the upside of upgrading this is just too niche within the starter deck for it to be a priority for me in act 1. Very strong with pyramid to ensure extra ignitions of the strongest ghostflames, especially when upgraded.",
