      "content": "Champ often struggles with transitioning from bursting down early game to transitioning towards a scaling plan for late game, and this card is certainly one way to try and bridge that gap. It's not exactly the most effective plan, because this is still just burst damage, and it's scaling is purely linear (even if champ does already like spamming skills). I do really like that it has retain, which allows you to hold onto it as a finisher, letting it build up damage and waiting to cast it. The retain also lets you use this after dumping your vigor into a big multihit attack, or to combo it with pen nib. Also plays very well with flurry of strikes and necronomicon.\n\nAs a rare, it's somewhat tough to take this. You usually will want more utility/long term scaling, as opposed to more burst damage as you clear the act 1 boss, and spending all those souls on a damage focused card doesn't round your deck out very well when you could be buying relics/card removes/utility cards instead. Champs rares aren't exactly the most exciting pool in the game anyways, but I would hope to do better than this most of the time.\n\nUpgrade is usually pretty solid, you only need to play 4 skills to be getting a decent deal, and every trigger beyond that is pure gravy. A deck that is good at proccing this card will naturally have good synergies with letter opener and ink bottle as well. It's by no means a bad card, but champ is rarely hurting for burst damage, and really needs to to scale much harder than this can offer.",

But given the way that champ plays this acutally scales up pretty fast (for a card you don't even need to play) even without an upgrade. It's very similar to sands of time, its servers as a pretty efficient way to add extra damage to any champ deck for medium/long fights. Drawing into this card can be slightly hard since champ does not have too much card draw available; which is a minor problem since you want this in your hand asap.",
