      "content": "Definitely a very powerful effect, letting you dig up any 1 (2) exhausted ethereal cards. Extra strong if you have apparitions that this can grab for you, likely game winning. Outside of that massive synergy, this will more tupically grab afterlife cards, giving you the option to play them again, or to let them exhaust again and get the purple text for free. With a good selection of afterlife cards (4+), this can form a nice little toolbox to get a variety of useful effects on demand, and when it's upgraded, it can help your output tremendously on one turn. You do need to play slightly differently with this in your deck, making sure to let some of your afterlife cards exhaust themselves so that you can dig them back up later. It's pretty hard to take nightmare vision when you only have 1 or 2 afterlife cards (which is a rare spot to find yourself in, as most of them are quite strong options) since it does nothing if you haven't drawn and exhausted an afterlife card already in the fight. It can be inconsistent without enough afterlife cards, or if you aren't playing carefully to make sure you exhaust some of them before drawing this.\n\nThis is one of several card with very powerful effects and retract, and most decks can afford to take 2 or 3 of those without severely messing with their wheel progression. If you find the right pieces, you can look for the very powerful counterclockwise deck where you intentionally use retract to light the flames in reverse, and this card is much stronger there than in a more traditional wheel focused deck.",

      "content": "Usually I would look to take this after taking and upgrading some particularly strong afterlife cards, or after finding apparitions. It's a little bit too airy and draw order dependent for act 1 in my opinion, but once your deck has more cards in it, the toolbox utility of being able to pull back specific cards becomes much more valuable in acts 2, 3 and 4. The upgrade is very strong, and definitely worth pursuing once you have 4+ afterlife cards so that you can consistently bring 2 good ones back. Runic pyramid helps smooth out some of the issues with drawing this too early, and especially with drawing it on the same turn as good afterlife cards you'd like to bring back. Great with dead branch, since you want to be exhausting your afterlife cards with that anyways, and this also exhausts to get you an extra card. Helps to trigger ink bottle and letter opener as a 0 cost skill that gets you more cards.",
