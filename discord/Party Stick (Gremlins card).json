      "content": "Considering how much gremlins love spamming cards, this can be extremely powerful as a way to keep the energy flowing to play everything. On the other hand, it can be a brick if you don't draw it alongside some swapping cards, or enough card draw/expensive cards to actually benefit from the extra energy. You can definitely go infinite with enthusiasm as well, so this card has a huge range of power depending on where you're at when you see it. Runic pyramid is one of the biggest enablers here, and even just having tag team upgraded or 4-5 swapping cards in your deck can also make this work nicely. Having access to raid (or other card draw) to smooth out the variance is also going to help this out. Upgrading party stick is probably not necessary most of the time, but can make sense if you have pyramid, or if your deck really values the energy gain and plays a long/slow enough game to get to a reshuffle (often not the case for gremlins).\n\nBe very careful of taking this too early, it's dreadful in act 1, and there's no guarantee you find the right tools to support it. It could easily be a dead draw for a long time unless you already have 3 swap cards, and even then it will still have consistency problems. I would usually look to add this fairly late in a run to go over the top of act 3 and the boss gauntlet with the acceleration/infinite potential it provides. Pretty good with snecko eye, since it increases card draw, and the extra energy could help smooth out an awkwardly expensive hand.",

With the support of raid or an upgrade this card can potentially provide infinite energy as long as you can draw it on turns where you are swapping. Since you typically want to swap between 2 or more gremlins, I expect this card to generate on average 2 energys a turn starting at the mid game; which is pretty good. but 2 energy a turn directly competes with revel, another energy giving card thats easier to use because it does not exhaust and grants the energy instantly. However party stick does not have a floor for how much energy it can give. Its one for each swap; so your encouraged to take as many swapping cards as possible with this card.",

Most notaibly is the shop relic that just gives 2 tag teams; not only is that relic incredible already but having it offers a prefect excuse to take party stick and enthusiasm (and just going down the swap spam strategy in general)",

      "content": "so far I'm treating party stick pretty well, but thats because i've negated to mention its true downside until now. Its very hard to acutally pivot towards this style of deck. I wont deny the strength Enthusiasm can have if you commit to it but you do have to commit because typically you don't want to swap repetitively. so that you can get the full value out of the cards you have already drafted. For example a card like show stopper; one of gremlins most powerful attacks is completely useless when your not spending the majority of your turn with gremlin wizard active. The issue with these swap decks is that playing one means leaning away from using powerful combos that crucially can be more easily acquired.",

Since you can just play all of your attacks while sneaky is active (it helps that no swap cards are attacks). I've found that a good time to consider swap spam is as a pivot in a sneaky gremlin based deck; since it has the easiest time to transition and can do it quickly (since sneaky gremlin excels in killing hallway fights)",

Fat gremlin and wizard gremlin don't like swapping very much and if you try taking a speculative party stick; it will  become dead weight until you find support like Enthusiasm or conga line; if those cards even come at all (doing so in reverse order is easier but it still feels bad to have an enthusiasm that is only drawing you 1 card a turn).",

      "content": "imo the main strength gremlins have is that you can imminently become very strong by infesting into 1 gremlin early. Then later in the run you can prepare your deck to defeat the games strongest threats. This is often done by incorporating another gremlin or 2 into your main strategy, although sometimes you can just double down on the power of 1 gremlin and go on a solo mission. The issue party stick and by extension the decks it enables have is that its difficult to incorporate it into a run that already in progress and due to the nature of the cards being support based you cannot start off the run with them ether.",
