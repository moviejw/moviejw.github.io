      "content": "I feel like this card should be good in the right circumstances, but I very rarely end up taking it. The damage is low, and really struggles to compete against other front-loaded options for hermit. In theory it has the potential to deal massive amounts of damage if you have a huge dead-on turn, and can be particularly potent when combined with defensive dead-on cards and smoking barrel/deadeye/bruise. Lining all that up in practice has been very finicky, since you need to play this after all the dead-on cards, but trying to do that often means that ricochet gets in the middle of your hand and has to be played earlier in the turn to enable the dead-on cards. There are also just significant consistency issues. If a strike is blocking your dead-on cards, that will consume the vigor and ruin the combo, you may draw ricochet, but only draw 1 or 0 dead-on cards at the same time, or you may simply have drawn the dead-on cards in the wrong position. I personally really dislike cards with this much room for things to go wrong, as their inconsistent output can really cost you in fights where you need them to work, and I also don’t think the payoff is strong enough to justify putting in all that work.",

      "content": "Headshot fits in really nicely with the same strategy, is far more reliable, doesn’t deal any randomly targeted damage, and triggers smoking barrel. Spray n’ pray is a much more consistent card for paying off vigor/strength/bruise stacking, with far less work involved, that can even have curse and debuff synergies, and it also just deals better front-loaded damage in the early game. Magnum also can hit plenty of times naturally to scale off these bonuses, and just wants to be paired with card draw. I would take ricochet if I had lots of dead-on cards that I was very good at enabling and was lacking good front-loaded damage cards, and I hadn’t seen any of the better payoffs, but that is a very narrow cross section of circumstances. The upgrade is good, and multiplies the payout, but is weak if you aren’t consistently drawing it alongside multiple dead-on cards. Even in act 1, there are just so many better options for burst damage to handle early hallway fights and elites that this is rarely an appealing choice, and it can be difficult to justify adding more pure damage cards to your deck later in the run. Gets a little better at 4 energy, plays well with runic pyramid to smooth out inconsistencies, can be potent with pen nib to double down on the burst damage angle.",

      "content": "strong card but its applications are very narrow. This has to slot into an existing deck that is able to use 3+ dead on cards a turn. What can make ricochet worthwhile is that it scales with strength, bruise and smoking barrel's vigor more effectively then most cards. This makes it a strong card going into acts 3 and 4 where you can use it to damage cap the heart and take out elites like giant head and nemesis. The issue this card has is being overkill since you can't take it early or even mid game. You will have damage already by the time this card can be useful.",
