      "content": "The snekproof is nice to prevent this getting a nasty cost increase from muddle/snecko eye. The effect is alright, definitely useful if you have rolled some awkward unidentified cards in a fight and want to dig past them, and it can also be used to ditch cards that cost 3 after a muddle effect. Pairs well with unending supply to be able to dig further. The utility to try and redraw is nice, but this will leave you down 1 card (since it doesn't replace itself until upgraded) and can be inconsistent, or even a total blank if drawn alongside no off class cards. It's also airy, doing nothing in particular but costing you a draw, which can be dangerous against aggressive enemies, and especially gremlin nob and the chosen. I think if you want card draw on snecko, there are much better options (snake rake, exotic form, master eye, restock, unidentified draw in a pinch). Gets better in the lategame, since curses and statuses count as offclass cards as well, so you can use it to discard annoying ones and draw into real cards, though snecko also several other tools that can do the same thing, many of which are better cards overall (danger noodle, trash to treasure, to some extent nope).\n\nThe upgrade does make it card neutral, which fixes a lot of issues and inconsistencies. If you find it pre-upgraded, I think it's a much more reasonable take for the utility aspect, but I would rarely take this and then hope to upgrade it later. Runic pyramid makes it much easier to time this alongside lots of weak offclass cards you don't want to cast, and this also helps clean up bad cards from getting stuck in your hand with pyramid. Cheap way to proc ink bottle and letter opener, and can help you find more cheap cards to continue proccing them.",
