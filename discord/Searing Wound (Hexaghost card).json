      "content": "Definitely has it's place, but this is not the most appealing rare for hexaghost. You can try to build around soulburn, but it's usually simply part of your damage over the course of fights, and the main thing you want to work on is making sure you can reliably apply it on turn 1 (often from igniting the first searing ghostflame) so that you can get the damage out ASAP. Searing wound is interesting in that it lets you both double dip on the damage of soulburn, and deal damage early in shorter fights. It does work well in both longer and shorter fights because of that, and since it only costs 1, you don't really need to stack more than 9 soulburn for this to feel like you're getting a good deal from it. What you do need to worry about is the opportunity cost, since it's a rare. You will have to take this over other hexa rares at a boss reward, or pay a lot of souls for it at a merchant to obtain it. I don't think the effect is generally good enough to put in that kind of investment, and I am normally slightly sad to be taking this as a boss reward. Unless your deck/relics are very good at applying tons of soulburn very fast, this isn't usually doing all that much for you (a decently efficient frontloaded damage card). It can be useful in boss fights if you have lots of intensity scaling and can scale up and apply tons of soulburn later in the fight, using this to double dip and get to lethal. The AOE component is also notable, though you will need to draft and draw copies of flames from beyond, volcano visage, and firestarter to really benefit from that, which can be tricky to line up.\n\nDrawing this at the right time can be an issue, since you can draw it too late to cash in on large amounts of soulburn, and you can also draw it too early at a point when you don't have much applied yet. Runic pyramid is a big help, and heat shield can also help delay soulburn to find more time to draw searing wound.",

In long fights, you should be able to stack enough intensity/soulburn up that playing this once and doubling the value of that soulburn is enough to finish the fight on it's own (and you're likely not playing it during the first cycle through the deck as you wait to scale up). I don't think removing exhaust from this is helpful in that many situations (I guess you could use rewind to get this back from the discard to line it up better/get a third helping of soulburn damage). Searing wound gets much better/more reliable when you can get soulburn going quickly, so that you can avoid it being a weak/dead draw in the early turns, so try to get more attacks and ways to trigger soulburn ASAP.",
