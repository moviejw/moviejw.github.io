      "content": "excellent card. The floor for this is 14 damage for 0 when using sneaky gremlin, upgrading to deal 21. This is several copies of slice in 1 card; its an snap pick in act 1 and even worth taking beyond that in later acts if you have a reason to use shivs. You still get the shivs when you discard the card with raid / tricksy; which makes your raids much better since they effectively cost 1 less to discard. Can occasionally clog the hand but you can play around it so its not a big problem overall.",

      "content": "As has already been mentioned, it's very similar to blade dance. You get the shivs upon drawing this, so it does have some advantages in terms of not casting cards/skills, some drawbacks in terms of deck clog if you don't play the shivs (thorns) and not giving you an extra card played for things like flurry, letter opener, and ink bottle. The big difference is that it doesn't cost you any energy to use this, so it's 8(12) damage for 0, which is very efficient, and of course you can use those shivs to proc ninja relics as well as two of the gremlins passives. \n\nThis card does very well in the early game as a solid source of frontloaded damage that lets you cast more of the cards you draw while stuck on 3 energy, and notably does well into all 3 elites (not great after lagavulins first debuff, but you will often win that fight fast anyways). You can also combine it raid as an easy card to discard. Quite bad with strange spoon, and with runic pyramid. The upgrade is very strong for a 0 cost card, a full +4 damage, an extra card to spam and get passive bonuses from/trigger relics with, though if you are having issues with hand/deck clog, it will make those worse. Incredibly powerful with dead branch to get even more cards with it. Any source of strength like vajra, du-vu doll, girya, or tricky's bolster rod will boost the damage from this very effectively. The relic synergies this card has are truly impressive, and it will often get better over the course of the run as you naturally pick more up. It definitely feels like this card is too powerful, 8 damage for 0 is a fantastic floor, and it also has direct synergy with 3 of the gremlin passives.",
