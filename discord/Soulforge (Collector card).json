      "content": "Pretty strong card, you're up a card for 0 energy, and collected cards are usually stronger than main deck cards (If you are picky during drafting). Upgrading the copy is also really helpful, as many of them do have cost reductions, or are powers that give better scaling. The floor on this is already pretty high at being +1 (+2) cards, and while there is some randomness in terms of what it pulls, plenty of collected cards are great to get multiples of (sentries, lagavulin, most powers, louse, darklings, etc). It also has some great value as a way to spam collected cards for synergies with omen, shadow daggers, and feel my pain, and works as a way to access your most powerful tools in the collected faster than the normal 1 per turn limit. Pairs really well with double trouble to give it more options to work with and double up on an upgraded card. \n\nThere can be some issues with not being able to cast all the copies, especially once you upgrade soulforge, but you wouldn't have had the copies if you just drew the collected card normally anyways, so I don't think you're missing out on that much. In addition, collector has access to reserves, and has enough synergies with expensive cards that you are already usually going to want to bias towards taking the 4th energy. In the very early game, this being a skill, not having very much energy, and you not having a particularly large collected deck (thus making running out of free cards to draw midfight a concern) make soulforge worse, but once you're past gremlin nob and have 5+ collectibles, I think it's a great pickup, and it's not outrageous to take one earlier than that if you have good frontloaded damage/potions already.",
