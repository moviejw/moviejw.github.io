Upfrount it blocks for 6 while blocking 3 more for the rest of the fight; thats already a much better metalise and its only a common so you can stack 3 of them. Of course you are limited by slime slots and leeching slime exhaust, so if you want to keep it in play you have to ether not play split or only have leeching slimes in your deck. But having only leeching slimes and some potently is a very viable block strategy if you can get your damage elsewhere. If you invest in other slimes leeching can still serve as a good temporary block source when you toss it down.",

Slimes are at their best when they are being used as support for your deck rather then the centerpiece of your strategy. Viewing slimes as support also makes abosrbing them much better since you acutally have attacks to benefit from the strength and if you try you can get a lot of strength from slimes really quickly with the many good cards that absorb your slimes for you. Plus with cards like glop chop and darklings you can mass produce so many slimes that they auto absorb and give you the strength and with commands they even do damage on the way out!",

      "content": "A very powerful common card that tends to perform well over the whole run, regardless of strategy. Unless you are spamming lots of slimes to build up strength, this card gives you a decent amount of frontloaded block, and then continues to give you more over the rest of your turns. Especially nice if you can command frequently and keep the leeching slime in the right position to build up even more block. If anything, it's too dominant, each of the 4 basic slimes deals damage, but this one blocks as well, giving it a lot more utility. Mire is the only one that comes close, with the goop it provides being helpful for proccing consume several times over the course of the fight (though there are plenty of other ways to do that as well). I have definitely felt disincentivized from picking up other split cards once I have 1-2 copies of this in order to keep the leeching slimes around.\n\nDefinitely gets better if you can find potency, but it certainly doesn't need it. It is fairly high value because slime boss can struggle to find effective mitigation tools sometimes. The upgrade is quite minor, though considering that this is a mettalicize style effect, getting 3 more frontloaded block can help smooth consistency as you set up your scaling. Strange spoon can be fun with heavy slime splitting synergies, and it can let you use other slimes (and build up strength with absorb) without worrying as much about losing your block engine.",
