      "content": "Was quite a bit better when it used to upgrade to make 2 stasis slots. Now that the upgrade is cost reduction, it's just a little bit too low impact to feel great. I still take this in decks with planning, reroute, recover, future plans, and sentry blast as way to make more room to develop cards, but it doesn't perform as well as something with more immediate impact like stasis strike (which can also create more slots if you draw it again, or loop it with reroute/recover). If you're going to invest in this, you really want to make sure you can fill up your stasis slots quickly to get the value of the extra card draw/energy gain. It also has to compete with the very powerful incinerate+ and temporal shield (and other sources of accelerate). They functionally do a very similar job by getting cards out of stasis quicker, which frees up your starting 3 slots to put more cards back in, and have much more of a frontloaded impact than capacitor does. \n\nThere are only two other ways to get more stasis slots, cryo chamber as a rare relic, and stasis strike as a slightly below rate frontloaded damage card, also at uncommon. For decks that want to quickly fill their slots up and play lots of 0 cost cards (stasis engine, floating orbs, ninja relics, letter opener) there just aren't that many options, so you do often pick up a capacitor, especially heading towards the later stages of a run to give you more scaling power. It's somewhat unusual to be in a spot where you can fill up stasis slots quickly enough to need more in act 1, and you really want cards with immediate impact at that point.\n\nThe upgrade is not a priority unless I am really struggling with energy. It can help you cover for it by playing some more block/damage cards on the same turn, but I usually have higher priority upgrades that can give better scaling. Mummified hand, bird face urn, and bolster rod make this a little easier to include, and I certainly do like having one for lategame scaling if nothing else.",

Simply having slots instead (or in addition too) accelerate greatly minimizes your dependance on draw order and makes decks really consistent. Generally speaking, if you can put a card in stasis to make it free; thats pretty good even if you have to wait the full to get the card back. Time capacitor is a very low commitment at just 1 energy and powers are basically not punished at all in downfall mode so your free to spam them. Stasis slots are very hard to come by, so time capacitor gets a lot of value from being unique in guardians kit (for the record I think stasis strike is a better card then this).",
